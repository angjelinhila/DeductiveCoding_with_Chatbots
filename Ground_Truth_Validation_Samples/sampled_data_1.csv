"The employee contended that the official's denial of any conversations with the contractor, and the employee's allegations of the official's misconduct outside the scope of his employment, precluded application of the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act). Thus, the employee argued that the official was not immune from suit and that substitution of the United States for the official and removal to federal court were not required. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the scope-of-employment certification was statutorily conclusive, and thus, the Westfall Act applied, unless and until it was determined as a matter of fact that the official engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment. The government's certification that the official acted within the scope of his employment and removal of the action to federal court were not controlled by the employee's allegations, and immunity under the Westfall Act encompassed the official being on duty at the time and place of the incident alleged in the employee's complaint, even though the official denied that the incident occurred.",Government Operations,Procurement & Contractors
"While 151 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USCS 151) grants the Federal Communications Commission authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, 152(b) of the Act (47 USCS 152(b)) expressly denies the Commission jurisdiction with respect to intrastate communications service. An association of regulatory utility commissioners petitioned the Commission for clarification of a 1981 Commission order regarding the depreciation of inside wiring. The Commission eventually determined (1) that 220 of the Act (47 USCS 220), dealing expressly with depreciation, operated automatically to pre-empt inconsistent state action where the Commission had prescribed depreciation rates for a carrier, or, alternatively, (2) that federal displacement of state regulations was justified under the Act in this situation, to avoid frustration of validly adopted federal policies. Upon appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding (1) that the authority to pre-empt state practices was statutorily entrusted to the Commission, and (2) that the regulations at issue were reasonably designed to insure that federal objectives would not be frustrated (737 F2d 388). The Court of Appeals did not reach the question as to whether 220 had an automatic pre-emption effect.",Technology,Telecommunications

"The Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC) is an Arkansas state agency owning and operating a network of noncommercial television stations. In 1992, AETC's staff planned a televised debate among candidates for Arkansas' Third Congressional District. Because of time constraints, the staff decided to limit participation in the debate to the major party candidates or any other candidate who had strong popular support. An independent candidate who was certified as qualified to appear on the ballot for the seat in question requested permission to participate in the debate. AETC's executive director, in denying the request, asserted that AETC had made a bona fide journalistic judgment that the viewers would be best served by limiting the debate to the two major-party candidates who had already been invited. In a suit filed against AETC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, the independent candidate (1) claimed, among other matters, that he was entitled to participate in the debate under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment; and (2) sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the debate took place without the independent candidate's participation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in reversing the District Court's judgment in pertinent part, (1) concluded that the First Amendment claim was sufficient to survive a motion for dismissal, (2) held that AETC was required to have a legitimate reason to exclude the independent candidate strong enough to survive First Amendment scrutiny, and (3) remanded the case for further proceedings (22 F3d 1423, 1994 US App LEXIS 8984, cert denied 513 US 995, 130 L Ed 2d 409, 115 S Ct 500). On remand, (1) the District Court determined that the debate was a nonpublic forum, (2) the jury found that AETC's decision to exclude the independent candidate had not been influenced by political pressure or disagreement with his views, and (3) judgment was entered for AETC. The Court of Appeals, in reversing, expressed the view that the debate was a public forum and that AETC's assessment of the independent candidate's ""political viability"" was not a compelling or narrowly tailored reason for excluding him from the debate (93 F3d 497, 1996 US App LEXIS 21152).",Government Operations,Political Campaigns

"These cases presented the question whether enforcement of summonses served by the Internal Revenue Service on taxpayers' attorneys in investigations of possible civil or criminal liability under the federal income tax laws--which summonses directed the attorneys to produce relevant documents of the taxpayers' accountants that had been given to the attorneys by the taxpayers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice in the tax investigations--violated the taxpayers' Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In case No. 74-18, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted enforcement of the summons (352 F Supp 731), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the taxpayers there involved had never acquired a possessory interest in the documents, and that the documents were not immune in the hands of their attorney (500 F2d 683). In case No. 74-611, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted enforcement of the summons against the taxpayer's attorney (enforcement also being granted as to a summons that had been served on the taxpayer's accountant), but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed in pertinent part, holding that under the Fifth Amendment, the documents would have been privileged if production had been sought from the taxpayer while he retained possession of the documents, and that in light of the confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship, the taxpayer retained constructive possession of the evidence and thus retained Fifth Amendment protection (499 F2d 444).",Government Operations,Tax Administration

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed, holding that the open fields doctrine permitted the search (686 F2d 356).

"The tribe contended that the Government acted as a fiduciary on behalf of the tribe and was thus precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against the tribe with regard to matters concerning management of the tribal trust. The U.S. Supreme Court held, however, that the common-law fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege did not apply to the general trust relationship between the Government and the tribe. Although the Government's management of the tribal trust bore some resemblance to a private trust, the Government's trust obligations to the tribe were established and governed by statute rather than the common law, and the Government acted pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law rather than as a private trustee. Further, the tribe was not the real client since the Government did not use trust funds to obtain the legal advice, the Government sought advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a private trustee, and the advice could be obtained to balance competing interests. Also, the Government's trust responsibilities were explicitly delineated by statute and did not include the common-law disclosure sought by the tribe.",Public Lands,Indigenous Affairs
"The copyright-clause portion of the Federal Constitution's copyright and patent clause (Art I, 8, cl 8) grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings. In 1998, Congress, in the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), amended 17 USCS 302 and 304 to generally increase the duration of both existing and future copyrights from (1) the time of the work's creation until 50 years after the author's death, to (2) the time of the work's creation until 70 years after the author's death. Some individuals and businesses whose products or services built on copyrighted works that had gone into the public domain brought against the Attorney General of the United States an action seeking a determination that the CTEA's extension (1) of existing copyrights violated the ""limited"" times prescription of the Constitution's copyright clause, and (2) of existing and future copyrights violated the free speech guarantee of the Constitution's First Amendment. After the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a judgment on the pleadings for the Attorney General (74 F Supp 2d 1), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, affirming, concluded that the CTEA's increased copyright term (1) was limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit within Congress' discretion; and (2) did not impermissibly restrict free speech (345 US App DC 89, 239 F3d 372).

"Under 21 USCS 841(b)(1), certain mandatory minimum sentences are imposed for trafficking in controlled substances, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), based on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance involved. In 1988, an individual was arrested for selling 11,456 doses of LSD on blotter paper. The combined weight of the LSD and the paper was 109.51 grams. Following a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the accused was convicted on two LSD-related counts. At the time of the accused's initial sentencing, 2D1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (18 USCS Appx) provided that the determinative amount for purposes of sentencing was the whole weight of the blotter paper containing the LSD. The accused was sentenced pursuant to 21 USCS 841(b)(1)(A)(v), which specified a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence where the total weight of the LSD and blotter paper involved exceeded 10 grams. In 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission retroactively revised 2D1.1 to provide that each dose of LSD on a carrier medium was to be given a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams. Thereafter, the accused filed a motion to modify his sentence on the ground that the weight of the LSD attributable to him under 2D1.1 as amended was 4.58 grams, for which amount the applicable sentencing range was 70 to 87 months. However, the District Court ruled that, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Chapman v United States (1991) 500 US 453, 114 L Ed 2d 524, 111 S Ct 1919, the blotter paper must be weighed in determining whether an accused crossed the 10-gram threshold for the mandatory minimum sentence imposed under 841(b)(1)(A)(v), notwithstanding the sentencing range under 2 D1.1 (846 F Supp 1362).

"A method employed in 1969 for selecting job applicants for positions with a California county's fire department had a disparate impact on the hiring of blacks and Mexican-Americans. The county, voluntarily in 1971, developed new procedures for screening job applicants, such new procedures involving a written examination graded on a pass-fail basis, the selection of 500 of the passing applicants at random for oral interviews and physical agility tests, and the ranking of passing applicants on an eligibility list in terms of the results of the physical agility tests and oral interviews. In 1972 the written test implementing the 1971 procedures was given, but before random selections could be made, an action was brought in a California state court against the county alleging that the random selection process violated provisions of the county charter and civil service regulations. The state court enjoined the county from using the random selection method pending trial on the merits, and ultimately the county, being unable to devise a nonrandom method of screening job applicants and lacking the resources to interview all of the applicants who had passed the 1972 examination, stopped hiring. When vacancies in the fire department increased and manpower needs became critical, the county's Department of Personnel proposed to expedite the hiring of sufficient firefighters to meet immediate urgent requirements by interviewing the top 544 scorers on the 1972 written test, of whom 492 were white, 10 black, and 33 Mexican-American. Although such plan was abandoned and not put into effect when minority representatives objected to it, it was challenged as violative of 42 USCS 1981 in an action brought in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the county, its Board of Supervisors, and its Civil Service Commission by a class of all present and future black and Mexican-American applicants for jobs with the county fire department. The District Court, among other things, found that although the defendants had acted without discriminatory intent, 42 USCS 1981 had been violated because the 1972 written examination had not been validated as predictive of job performance, and the court, enjoining all future discrimination, entered a remedial hiring order whereby at least 20% of all new firefighter recruits were required to be black and another 20% were required to be Mexican-American until the percentages of blacks and Mexican-Americans in the fire department was commensurate to their percentages in the county. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the District Court's holding that the 1972 proposal to use an unvalidated civil service examination violated 1981 (566 F2d 1334).",Civil Rights,Minority Discrimination

On appeal by class members who objected to the settlement, the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed (676 So 2d 1265).

The indictment further charged that when the defendant did file such a form, he knowingly and wilfully understated the number of employees accepting wagers on his behalf--in violation of 18 USC 1001, the general criminal provision punishing the making of fraudulent statements to the government. In the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that the wagering tax laws that required him to file the special return had been held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. The government did not pursue the charges under 4411 and 4412, but argued that the alleged invalidity of the wagering tax laws was ""largely irrelevant"" to the 1001 charge. The District Court dismissed the indictment, reasoning that the defendant could not be prosecuted for his ""failure to answer the wagering form correctly,"" since his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would have prevented prosecution for ""failure to answer the form in any respect"" (unreported memorandum; 298 F Supp 1260).",Government Operations,Tax Administration

"A father and son were indicted in multiple counts for mail fraud, in connection with insurance claims that were made and that insurers paid for fire damage to a restaurant and a duplex that the father had hired an arsonist to burn. Count 1 charged the father with mail fraud with regard to the restaurant fire, and Counts 2 through 4 charged both defendants with mail fraud related to the duplex fire. They were also charged in Count 5 with conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with a third arson scheme. In Count 6, the son was charged with perjury before the grand jury. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied the defendants' motion for severance, wherein they contended that the charged offenses were misjoined in violation of Rule 8(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. When evidence relating to the restaurant fire was admitted, the trial judge instructed the jury not to consider that evidence against the son, which instruction the court repeated in the final charge, together with an instruction regarding the separate consideration to be given each defendant and each count. The jury returned convictions on all counts. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Counts 2 through 6 were properly joined, but that Count 1 should not have been joined. Holding that the misjoinder was prejudicial per se, the Court of Appeals reversed the defendants' convictions and remanded for new trials. The Court of Appeals also held that there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for mail fraud under Counts 2 through 4, because each mailing was in execution of fraud and was designed to lull the insurer into a false sense of security and postpone investigation (735 F2d 799).

"The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (note following 10 USCS 2687), prescribes a process under which, for each of three rounds of base closings, (1) the Secretary of Defense submits recommendations to an independent Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission; (2) the Commission submits a report, including an assessment of the Secretary's recommendations and the Commission's own recommendations, to the President of the United States; (3) the President decides whether to approve the Commission's recommendations by accepting or rejecting the entire package offered by the Commission; and (4) if the President approves, then the President submits the recommendations along with a certification of approval to Congress, which has a short period to enact a joint resolution of disapproval, or else the recommendations must be carried out. In April 1991, the Secretary recommended the closure or realignment of a number of defense bases, including the closure of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The Commission's subsequent recommendations to the President agreed that the shipyard ought to be closed. The then President approved the Commission's recommendations in July 1991, and the House of Representatives rejected a joint resolution of disapproval. Meanwhile, however, 2 days before the President submitted his certification of approval to Congress, some shipyard employees and their unions, members of Congress, states and state officials, and the city of Philadelphia filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 USCS 701 et seq.) and the 1990 Act, against defendants including the Secretary and the Commission. The plaintiffs (1) included a claim that the Secretary and another official had violated the 1990 Act's procedural requirements in recommending the shipyard's closure; (2) made similar allegations regarding the Commission's recommendations to the President; and (3) sought to enjoin the Secretary from carrying out the President's decision to close the shipyard. The District Court, however, dismissed the complaint on the alternative grounds that (1) the 1990 Act itself precluded judicial review; and (2) the political question doctrine foreclosed judicial intervention (777 F Supp 1226). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in affirming in part and reversing in part, expressed the view that (1) the plaintiffs, although not naming the President as a defendant, were asking for review of a decision by the President; (2) the President's actions had never been considered immune from judicial review solely because they were taken by the President; and (3) certain procedural claims--such as a claim that the Secretary had failed to transmit to the Commission all the information which he had used in making his recommendations, and a claim that the Commission had not held public hearings as required by the 1990 Act--were thus reviewable (971 F2d 936). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of a Supreme Court decision in another case (506 US ____, 121 L Ed 2d 364, 113 S Ct 455). On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision, as the court, although apparently recognizing that review was unavailable under the APA, expressed the view that judging the President's actions for compliance with the 1990 Act was a permitted form of constitutional review (995 F2d 404).",Defense,Civilian Personnel

"Customs officials seized 37 kilograms of marijuana from defendant's gas tank at the international border. A grand jury indicted defendant of unlawfully importing marijuana and of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendant moved to suppress the marijuana. The district court granted the motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. The appellate court held that the Fourth Amendment forbade the fuel tank search absent reasonable suspicion. The Supreme Court found that complex balancing tests to determine what was a ""routine"" search of a vehicle, as opposed to a more ""intrusive"" search of a person, had no place in border searches of vehicles. Searches made at the border were reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occurred at the border. It was difficult to imagine how the search of a gas tank, which should have been solely a repository for fuel, could have been more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment. A gas tank search involved a brief procedure that could have been reversed without damaging the safety or operation of the vehicle. While the interference with a motorist's possessory interest was not insignificant when the United States removed, disassembled, and reassembled his gas tank, it nevertheless was justified by the United States' paramount interest in protecting the border. The United States' authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border included the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicle's fuel tank.",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code

"Pursuant to its Revised Constitution, which had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, the Tribal Council of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe enacted an ordinance imposing a severance tax on oil and gas production on the tribal land, the tax applying to any oil and natural gas severed, saved, and removed from tribal lands, but not applying to oil and gas consumed by lessees of the Tribe to develop their leases or received by the Tribe as in-kind royalty payments, and the ordinance was approved by the Secretary.

After the plan had been in operation for more than twelve years, a general creditor whose attorney had proposed the plan petitioned the bankruptcy court for a decree to the effect that the two judgment creditors had waived their liens by sharing in distributions from the general fund.",Domestic Commerce,Bankruptcy
