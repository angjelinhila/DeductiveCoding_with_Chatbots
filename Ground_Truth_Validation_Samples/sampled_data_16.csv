"At the trial of a defendant who had been indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on three counts of federal narcotics violations, the jury acquitted him of one count but was unable to reach a verdict on the two remaining counts. The District Court declared a mistrial as to these remaining counts and scheduled a retrial. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and also moved to bar retrial on the ground that a second trial would violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment because evidence sufficient to convict on the remaining counts had not been presented by the government at the first trial. The District Court denied both motions and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the defendant's appeal from the denial of these motions for want of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reasoned that its jurisdiction to review the jeopardy claim depended on the appealability of the ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence, that the ruling on the latter motion was not a final judgment appealable under 28 USCS 1291, that the ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence was not within the collateral order doctrine, and that since the merits of the double jeopardy claim depended entirely on the legal sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant had failed to present a double jeopardy claim which could be reviewed at this point (702 F2d 1079).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) is a comprehensive environmental statute that empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate hazardous waste in accordance with the rigorous safeguards and waste management procedures of Subtitle C (42 USCS 6921-6934), while nonhazardous wastes are regulated much more loosely under Subtitle D (42 USCS 6941-6949). The city of Chicago owned and operated a municipal incinerator that burned solid waste and recovered energy, leaving a residue of ash. In 1988, an environmental organization (1) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the city and its mayor under RCRA's citizen suit provision (42 USCS 6972); and (2) alleged that the city and the mayor were violating provisions of RCRA and of implementing EPA regulations. While it was uncontested that with respect to the incinerator ash, the city and the mayor had not adhered to Subtitle C's requirements, the city and the mayor contended that the ash was exempted from those requirements by 3001(i) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 USCS 6921(i))--an RCRA provision which had been added in a 1984 amendment as a clarification of a household waste exclusion from regulation, after the EPA had issued some 1980 regulations involving such an exclusion. The District Court agreed with the contention of the city and the mayor (727 F Supp 419) and subsequently granted a motion by the city and the mayor for summary judgment. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in 1991, reversed on the ground that the ash generated from the incinerators of municipal resource recovery facilities was subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C 48 F2d 345). In 1992, the Administrator of EPA issued a memorandum expressing the agency's view to the effect that pursuant to 3001(i), municipal waste combustion ash was exempt from hazardous waste regulation under Subtitle C. Thereafter, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of the EPA memorandum (506 US ____, 121 L Ed 2d 426, 113 S Ct 486). On remand, however, the Court of Appeals reinstated its previous opinion, expressing the view that because the statute's plain language was dispositive, the EPA memorandum did not affect the Court of Appeals' analysis (985 F2d 303).",Environment,Hazardous Waste
"A California statute sought to change the manner in which the state paid benefits under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), for which the state receives partial reimbursement from the Federal Government, to limit new residents, for the first year that they live in California, to the benefits paid in the state from which the new residents came. Such a change required a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which the Secretary granted. However, some new residents who received AFDC benefits challenged the constitutionality of the California statute in a Federal District Court, which enjoined the payment differential between new and old residents (811 F Supp 516). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (26 F3d 95) and, after ruling on the case, vacated the HHS waiver in a separate proceeding.",Social Welfare,General Social Welfare
"An interstate rail carrier which had experienced financial problems of increasing severity over several years agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to a corporation which was not yet engaged in providing rail carrier service. The prospective buyer intended to operate the railroad as the carrier had, except that the buyer would not assume the carrier's collective bargaining contracts with its various unions and would employ only about 250 employees, rather than the 750 then working for the carrier. The unions, upon being notified of the impending sale, asserted to the carrier in writing that under a provision of the Railway Labor Act (RLA) (45 USCS 156) covering ""change[s] in agreements"" affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, the carrier was required to give the unions 30 days' written notice of the proposed sale and to bargain with the unions regarding the effects of the proposed sale on the employees. In response, the carrier stated that while it was willing to discuss the matter, notice and bargaining pursuant to 156 were not required, since the proposed sale was subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) (49 USCS 10101 et seq.), and since the imposition of the 156 requirements would intrude on the statutory regime of the ICA, as well as on the prerogatives of the carrier's management to conduct company affairs. After the carrier again declined to bargain with most of the unions involved, upon the unions' submission of proposals under which the carrier would guarantee that the sale would not cause any unemployment and the proposed buyer would assume the carrier's collective bargaining agreements, an association of the unions' executive officers filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the carrier, seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the carrier's obligations under the RLA and an injunction against the proposed sale pending the carrier's completion of its RLA bargaining obligations. The unions then went on strike, and the carrier filed a counterclaim in the District Court seeking to enjoin the strike. Several days later, the District Court denied the carrier's motion for a temporary restraining order, ruling that the requested injunctive relief was precluded by the Norris-La Guardia Act (NLGA) (29 USCS 101 et seq.). At about the same time, the prospective buyer filed with the ICC a request for an exemption from the requirements of the ICA, pursuant to an ex parte order issued by the ICC under which noncarriers were able to instead utilize abbreviated procedures for seeking ICC approval to acquire a carrier. After the ICC approved the request, the carrier reapplied to the District Court for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the strike. The District Court granted the request, ruling that the ICC's authorization of the proposed sale negated any duty the carrier had to bargain with its employees over the effects of the sale. On appeal by the association, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (in No. 87-1589) reversed and remanded, holding that the District Court was without jurisdiction to enter injunctive relief, because the ICA was not a statute to which the anti-injunction provisions of the NLGA must be accommodated (831 F2d 1231). On remand, the District Court, addressing the association's request for an injunction against the proposed sale, ruled that the carrier--while it had no duty to bargain over its decision to sell--was required by the RLA to satisfy its obligations under 156 to bargain with its employees over the effects of the sale before such sale could be consummated, the ICC's approval notwithstanding (677 F Supp 830). On appeal by the carrier, the Court of Appeals (in No. 87-1888) affirmed (845 F2d 420).",Transportation,Railroad Travel

"Employees brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, asserting that the defendant employer's employee insurance benefits and maternity leave regulations discriminated against women in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.), and seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees. The District Court issued an order which stated that ""final judgment"" would be entered in favor of the plaintiffs that the employer's policies on insurance and maternity leave violated federal law, and which ""directed"" that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs upon such ""claims"" since there was ""no just reason for delay."" On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that it had jurisdiction of the defendant's appeal under 28 USCS 1291, which gives the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction of appeals from all ""final decisions"" of the Federal District Courts, and affirmed the District Court's judgment on the merits (511 F2d 199).",Civil Rights,Gender Discrimination
"A state prisoner seized an officer's gun while receiving dental care at a local dentist's office, forced the dentist's assistant to accompany him as a hostage, and managed to escape. They fled to a nearby home. As the prisoner demanded the resident's car keys, the front door was slammed and the prisoner's gun went off. The bullet traveled through the wooden door and into the resident's chest killing him. The prisoner was subsequently tried in a state court on a charge of malice murder. His sole defense to the charge was a lack of the requisite intent to kill. On the dispositive issue of intent, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows: ""The acts of a person of sound mind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's will, but the presumption may be rebutted. A person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts, but the presumption may be rebutted. A person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention but the trier of facts, that is, the Jury, may find criminal intention upon a consideration of the words, conduct, demeanor, motive and all other circumstances connected with the act for which the accused is prosecuted."" The jury was also instructed that the defendant was presumed innocent and that the state was required to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury returned a verdict of guilty and the prisoner was sentenced to death. He unsuccessfully appealed the conviction and sentence, and exhausted state postconviction remedies. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia denied an application for habeas corpus relief without an evidentiary hearing. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and ordered that the writ issue, holding that the jury charge on intent ran afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment (720 F2d 1206 and 723 F2d 770).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an ‚Äö√Ñ√∫entry,‚Äö√Ñ√π upon their return from ‚Äö√Ñ√∫innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this country‚Äö√Ñ√¥s borders.‚Äö√Ñ√π Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures, creating a uniform ‚Äö√Ñ√∫removal‚Äö√Ñ√π proceeding. See 8 U. S. C. ¬¨√ü¬¨√ü1229, 1229a. Congress made ‚Äö√Ñ√∫admission‚Äö√Ñ√π the key word, and defined ‚Äö√Ñ√∫admission‚Äö√Ñ√π to mean ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.‚Äö√Ñ√π ¬¨√ü1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as seeking admission if they have ‚Äö√Ñ√∫committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2),‚Äö√Ñ√π ¬¨√ü1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a crime involving moral turpitude . . . or conspiracy to commit such a crime,‚Äö√Ñ√π ¬¨√ü1182(a)(2)(A)(i). Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence. In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s passage, Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In 2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking ‚Äö√Ñ√∫admission‚Äö√Ñ√π based on his 1994 conviction. At Vartelas‚Äö√Ñ√¥ removal proceedings, his attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief under former ¬¨√ü212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed. In 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s new ‚Äö√Ñ√∫admission‚Äö√Ñ√π provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion. The Second Circuit affirmed. Rejecting Vartelas‚Äö√Ñ√¥ argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.",Immigration,Immigration
"New York established an Emergency Assistance Program receiving substantial federal funding under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 603(a)(5)). In establishing its program, New York excluded recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) from emergency assistance in the form of cash and excluded public assistance recipients, including AFDC recipients, from reimbursement for lost or stolen grants, even though it provided such reimbursement to other public benefit recipients. A number of AFDC recipients brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin enforcement of the state law insofar as it denied Emergency Assistance pursuant to the no-cash provision and the loss-or-theft provision, arguing that the law conflicts with the Social Security Act and violated equal protection because it arbitrarily discriminated against AFDC recipients. Following a remand of its initial decision invalidating the provisions under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (Art VI, cl 2) (437 F Supp 1371, affirmed 508 F2d 1044), the District Court held that the state law was not inconsistent with 406(e) of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 606(e)), and upheld the loss-or-theft provision, but invalidated the no-cash provision as a violation of equal protection (493 F Supp 865). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that both the no-cash and the loss-or-theft provisions violated equal protection (648 F2d 801).",Social Welfare,
"An organization of private individuals and the United States each filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to compel the state of Pennsylvania to implement a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program (I/M program) as required by the Clean Air Act (42 USCS 7410). Pursuant to a consent decree, the state agreed to establish an I/M program for 10 counties in two metropolitan areas in the state. Under the decree, the state transportation department was required to seek legislation instituting a franchise I/M program, and if such legislation was not approved, the transportation department was to promulgate regulations allowing the state to certify a number of private garage facilities to perform the inspections. Implementation of the I/M program did not proceed smoothly, and the factual developments which followed the entry of the consent decree included the following: (1) after the transportation department published the proposed regulations, the state legislature having earlier failed to enact a franchise system, the organization continued to monitor the state's performance under the consent decree and submitted comments on the regulations; (2) after the state legislature enacted a statute prohibiting the expenditure of state funds by the executive branch for the implementation of the I/M program, the organization successfully opposed the state's motion to stay implementation of the consent decree, the Federal District Court ordering the United States Secretary of Transportation to refrain from approving any projects, or awarding any grants, for highways in the two areas covered by the consent decree, with certain exceptions (533 F Supp 869), and on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed (678 F2d 460); and (3) the organization participated in hearings before the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at which the state unsuccessfully sought the EPA's approval of an I/M program covering a smaller geographic area. The organization then sought attorneys' fees and costs for the work performed after the issuance of the consent decree. The Federal District Court awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the organization and, overruling the state's objections that the organization was seeking compensation for work done in only tangentially related state and federal administrative proceedings, held that the organization was entitled to such compensation for its work in monitoring the state's performance under the consent decree and commenting on the state's proposed regulations and for its participation in the hearings before the EPA; also, the District Court increased the ""lodestar"" amounts--the result of multiplying the number of hours reasonably necessary to perform the legal services for which compensation was sought by a reasonable hourly rate for the attorney providing the services (this rate being based on the court's determination of the attorney's reputation and status and the type of activity for which the attorney was seeking compensation)--with respect to the organization's work in opposing the state's motion to stay implementation of the consent decree, to reflect the low likelihood of success the organization faced in that stage of the litigation and the high quality of representation provided in that stage. The Court of Appeals affirmed and held that (1) the work of counsel in monitoring the state's performance under the consent decree, commenting on the state transportation department's regulations, and participating in the EPA hearings was useful and necessary for securing full enforcement of the decree; and (2) with respect to the adjustment of the lodestar amounts, the evidence showed that the success of counsel was exceptional, and that the quality of the service rendered was superior to that which one should reasonably expect in light of the hourly rates charged (762 F2d 272).",Law and Crime,Court Administration
"After a company discharged an Afro-American worker, purportedly for absenteeism, the worker (1) filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that he had been treated differently from white workers who had missed work; and (2) at the same time, applied for jobs with other employers, several of whom sought references from the company. The worker, having received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, then (1) filed a Federal District Court action against the company; (2) sought monetary and injunctive relief, under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) and 42 USCS 1981; (3) alleged that the company had (a) discharged him because of his race, and (b) retaliated against him for filing a charge with the EEOC, through the provision of inadequate references; and (4) requested a jury trial on all issues triable by a jury. At the beginning of the trial, however, the District Court dismissed the 1981 claims, on the ground that Title VII provided the exclusive remedy for the worker's alleged injuries. The District Court then (1) conducted a bench trial on the Title VII claims; (2) at the close of the worker's case in chief, granted the company's motion, under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the discriminatory-discharge claim, on the ground that the worker had not established a prima facie case; and (3) after both parties had presented all their evidence, entered a judgment in favor of the company on the retaliation claim. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, affirming, (1) noted that the dismissal of the 1981 claims was apparently erroneous, because the remedies under Title VII and 1981 were separate, independent, and distinct; but (2) ruled that the District Court's findings with respect to the Title VII claims collaterally estopped the worker from litigating his 1981 claims, because the elements of a cause of action under 1981 were identical to those under Title VII; and (3) determined that the Federal Constitution's Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury in suits at common law did not preclude according such a collateral estoppel effect to the District Court's findings, because the judicial interest in economy of resources overrode the worker's interest in relitigating the issues (831 F2d 1057).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), a private, for-profit corporation created by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (45 USCS 501 et seq.), operates passenger trains, generally on existing tracks owned and used by freight railroads, through means including ""trackage rights"" agreements. In addition, under 45 USCS 562(d)(1), if a railroad and Amtrak are unable to agree upon terms for the sale to Amtrak of railroad property ""required"" for intercity rail passenger service, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for an order establishing Amtrak's need for the property and requiring the conveyance of the property from the railroad to Amtrak on reasonable terms and conditions, including just compensation. Pursuant to 562(d)(1), Amtrak's need for the property is deemed to be established, unless the ICC finds that (1) conveyance of the property to Amtrak would significantly impair the railroad's ability to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and (2) Amtrak's obligation to provide rail passenger service can adequately be met by the acquisition of alternative property. When Amtrak became dissatisfied with a railroad's maintenance of a 48.8-mile segment of track used by an Amtrak passenger service, Amtrak reached a preliminary agreement with a second railroad which owned other parts of the same line, to the effect that (1) Amtrak would acquire the segment in question, reconvey the segment to the second railroad, and provide some funds for upgrading and rehabilitation; while (2) the second railroad would provide the balance of the upgrade funds, maintain the track, and grant trackage rights to Amtrak and the first railroad. Amtrak then made a purchase offer to the first railroad, but when Amtrak interpreted a response as a rejection, Amtrak instituted ICC proceedings. Eventually, the ICC--in issuing a final decision which ordered the segment's conveyance to Amtrak, with just compensation to the first railroad of more than $ 2.3 million--expressed the view, in the ICC's first decided case involving condemnation powers under 562(d), that (1) Amtrak had met the statutory conditions for the institution of proceedings; and (2) the first railroad had established neither of the two statutory criteria to rebut the statutory presumption of need. On petition for review, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--in granting the petition and in ordering a remand for further proceedings--expressed the view that 562(d) did not permit Amtrak to condemn railroad property which Amtrak intended to convey to another railroad, for no deference was due to the ICC's contrary interpretation, as 562(d) was unambiguous in light of its language and history (286 App DC 1, 911 F2d 743). While rehearing was pending, Congress in 1990, in specific response to the Court of Appeals' decision, added to 562(d)(1) a provision to the effect that Amtrak may subsequently convey title or other interest in acquired property to a third party, if the reconveyance is found by the ICC to further the purposes of the statute (PL 101-641, 9(a)); this amendment was made applicable to all pending cases (PL 101-641, 9(b)). The Court of Appeals, however, in denying rehearing, expressed the view that, while the 1990 addition made it clear that Amtrak was authorized to reconvey property subsequent to a condemnation that was otherwise valid under 562(d), the addition did not change the 562(d) limitation that the property be ""required"" in the first place (288 App DC 196, 925 F2d 427).",Transportation,Railroad Travel

"The United States instituted a civil antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, alleging principally that the acquisition by a company engaged in printing and selling color comic supplements for newspapers which did not print their own supplements, of all the stock of a second company engaged only in printing such supplements for a comic feature syndicate, which sold to newspapers, violated the prohibition of 7 of the Clayton Act against such an acquisition where the effect thereof may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country. After the acquisition was effected, the acquiring company controlled approximately 75 percent of independent color comic supplement printing, and the comic feature syndicate became dependent on the acquiring company for most of the printing of supplements, which the syndicate sold in competition with the acquiring company. After entry of a consent decree with regard to the comic feature syndicate's involvement in an alleged conspiracy to restrain the sale to newspapers of the printing of comic supplements, and after a full trial on the Clayton Act charge, the District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that (1) in considering the effects of the acquisition on competition in the comic supplement industry, the significant lines of commerce should be divided into the category of printing of supplements for papers which did not print their own, and the separate category of printing of supplements for syndicates engaged in selling copyrighted features to papers, (2) the acquisition did not result in substantial lessening of competition in the color comic supplement industry in violation of 7 of the Clayton Act, (3) the acquisition came within the ""failing company"" exception to 7, and (4) even if there had been a violation of 7, an order for divestiture would not be warranted, since 15 years had passed after the acquisition was effected.

"In the late 1990s, Csaba Truckai invented a device to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. The device, known as the NovaSure System, uses a moisture-permeable applicator head to destroy targeted cells in the uterine lining. Truckai filed a patent application and later assigned the application, along with any future continuation applications, to his company, Novacept, Inc. The PTO issued a patent for the device. Novacept, along with its portfolio of patents and patent applications, was eventually acquired by respondent Hologic, Inc. In 2008, Truckai founded petitioner Minerva Surgical, Inc. There, he developed a supposedly improved device to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Called the Minerva Endometrial Ablation System, the new device uses a moisture-impermeable applicator head to remove cells in the uterine lining. The PTO issued a patent, and the FDA approved the device for commercial sale. Meanwhile, Hologic filed a continuation application with the PTO, seeking to add claims to its patent for the NovaSure System. Hologic drafted one of its claims to encompass applicator heads generally, without regard to whether they are moisture permeable. The PTO issued the altered patent in 2015. Hologic then sued Minerva for patent infringement. As relevant here, Minerva rejoined that Hologic‚Äö√Ñ√¥s patent was invalid because the newly added claim did not match the invention‚Äö√Ñ√¥s written description, which addresses applicator heads that are water permeable. In response, Hologic invoked the doctrine of assignor estoppel. Because Truckai had assigned the original patent application, Hologic argued, he and Minerva could not impeach the patent‚Äö√Ñ√¥s validity.

"After being indicted for three counts of theft by a United States Postal Service employee and three counts of use of unauthorized credit cards, an accused agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas to one of the counts (""count four"")--in which the accused was charged with use of a particular unauthorized credit card issued by a certain bank--in exchange for the Federal Government's agreement (1) to dismiss the remaining counts, and (2) to forgo prosecution for any other offense arising in the federal district as part of the scheme alleged in the accused's indictment. During the plea proceeding, the government proffered evidence that the accused, in addition to having stolen the credit card identified in count four, also had stolen at least 15 other cards. The accused's counsel informed the court that the accused's guilty plea was confined to an admission of the facts pertaining to count four. The District Court accepted the accused's guilty plea. At a presentencing hearing, the government submitted that the accused should be ordered to pay restitution, pursuant to the restitution provisions of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), 18 USCS 3579 and 3580 (later recodified as 18 USCS 3663 and 3664), for the total of the bank's losses which related to the accused's alleged theft and use of 21 credit cards. In response, the accused offered to make restitution in an amount limited to the losses sustained by the bank as a result of the unauthorized uses of the credit card identified in count four. At sentencing, the District Court ordered the accused to make restitution to the bank in the amount requested by the government. The District Court denied the accused's motion to reduce and correct his sentence. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that the VWPA permitted a federal court to require restitution beyond that involved in the offense of conviction where there was a significant connection between the crime of conviction and similar actions which justified restitution (877 F2d 1256).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"With certain limitations, 18 USCS 922(g)(1) prohibits possession of a firearm by anyone who has been convicted of a felony--""a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."" An accused was indicted on federal charges of (1) assault with a dangerous weapon, (2) using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and (3) violating 922(g)(1) on the basis of a prior conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury. Before the accused's trial in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, he moved for a restrictive evidentiary order. The accused offered to stipulate that (1) he had been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, and (2) the government had proven one of the essential elements of the 922(g)(1) offense. According to the accused, this offer rendered any evidence of the name and nature of his prior offense inadmissible, under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, on the theory that the unfair prejudice to him would substantially outweigh the evidence's probative value. However, the government's attorney insisted on the right to prove the case in his own way. The District Court agreed with the government in an oral ruling. At trial, the government, over renewed objection, introduced a record of the accused's prior conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury, for which conviction he had been sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. A jury found the accused guilty on all counts.

In each of two California capital murder trials, (1) a jury found the accused guilty of first-degree murder and found one or more special circumstances to be true; (2) during the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider sentencing factors specified in the statute; and (3) the jury sentenced the accused to death. The two accused raised claims of unconstitutional vagueness, under the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment, with respect to three of the penalty-phase factors, as to (1) the circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted and the existence of any of the special circumstances found to be true; (2) the presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant involving the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence; and (3) the age of the defendant at the time of the crime. Both accused challenged the first factor, while one accused challenged the other two factors as well. On appeal, however, the Supreme Court of California rejected those vagueness claims in affirming the accused's convictions and death sentences (4 Cal4th 569, 842 P2d 1142; 4 Cal4th 499, 842 P2d 1100).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"The issue in the present case concerned the validity of a regulation, issued by a Colorado stockyard company under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which prohibited any market agency engaged in business at the stockyard from soliciting business for, or diverting it to, other markets with which the agency was registered. The validity of this regulation was challenged by a market agency which was registered not only with the Colorado stockyard company but also with other stockyards. The market agency filed a complaint with the Secretary of Agriculture, but did not offer any evidence as to the unreasonableness of the regulation, and its complaint was dismissed by the Judicial Officer (15 Agr Dec 638). On the agency's petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the decision of the Judicial Officer (241 F2d 192), holding that the regulation was void on its face.",Labor,Other Agriculture
"The Social Security Act regulates the fees that attorneys may charge claimants seeking Title II benefits for representation both before the Social Security Administration and in federal court. For representation in administrative proceedings, the Act provides two ways to determine fees. If a fee agreement exists, fees are capped at the lesser of 25% of past-due benefits or a set dollar amount‚Äö√Ñ√Æcurrently $6,000. 42 U.S.C. ¬¨√ü 406(a)(2)(A). Absent an agreement, the agency may set any ‚Äö√Ñ√∫reasonable‚Äö√Ñ√π fee. ¬¨√ü 406(a)(1). In either case, the agency is required to withhold up to 25% of past-due benefits for direct payment of any fee. ¬¨√ü 406(a)(4). For representation in court proceedings, fees are capped at 25% of past-due benefits, and the agency has authority to withhold such benefits to pay these fees. ¬¨√ü 406(b)(1)(A).
Petitioner Culbertson represented Katrina Wood in Social Security disability benefit proceedings before the agency and in District Court. The agency ultimately awarded Wood past-due benefits, withheld 25% of those benefits to pay any attorney's fees, and awarded Culbertson fees under ¬¨√ü 406(a) for representation before the agency. Culbertson then moved for a separate fee award under ¬¨√ü 406(b) for the court proceedings, requesting a full 25% of past-due benefits. The District Court granted the request, but only in part, because Culbertson did not subtract the amount he had already received under ¬¨√ü 406(a) for his agency-level representation. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the 25% limit under ¬¨√ü 406(b) applies to the total fees awarded under both ¬¨√ü¬¨√ü 406(a) and (b).",Social Welfare,General Social Welfare
"Cell phones perform their wide and growing variety of functions by con- tinuously connecting to a set of radio antennas called ‚Äö√Ñ√∫cell sites.‚Äö√Ñ√π Each time a phone connects to a cell site, it generates a time-stamped record known as cell-site location information (CSLI). Wireless carri- ers collect and store this information for their own business purposes. Here, after the FBI identified the cell phone numbers of several rob- bery suspects, prosecutors were granted court orders to obtain the suspects‚Äö√Ñ√¥ cell phone records under the Stored Communications Act. Wireless carriers produced CSLI for petitioner Timothy Carpenter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s phone, and the Government was able to obtain 12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s movements over 127 days‚Äö√Ñ√Æan average of 101 data points per day. Carpenter moved to suppress the data, arguing that the Government‚Äö√Ñ√¥s seizure of the records without obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause violated the Fourth Amend- ment. The District Court denied the motion, and prosecutors used the records at trial to show that Carpenter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s phone was near four of the robbery locations at the time those robberies occurred. Carpen- ter was convicted. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that Carpen- ter lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location infor- mation collected by the FBI because he had shared that information with his wireless carriers.",Civil Rights,Anti-Government Activity
"The Adolescent Family Life Act (42 USCS 300z et seq.), adopted in 1981, is a scheme for providing grants to public or nonprofit private organizations or agencies for services and research in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy. Grant recipients are to provide services for the care of pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents ( 300z-1(a)(7)) and the prevention of adolescent sexual relations ( 300z-1(a)(8)). The Act states that such services should promote the involvement of parents and other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups ( 300z(a)(10)(C)), and grant applicants are required to describe how they will involve such individuals and groups ( 300z-5(a)(21)). Among the services that may be funded are counseling and educational services ( 300z-1(a)(4)). The Act imposes limitations on the use of grant funds for family planning services ( 300z-3(b)(1)) and forbids grants to projects or programs that advocate, promote, or encourage abortion ( 300z-10(a)). There is no express provision in the Act preventing the use of federal funds for religious purposes, but a 1984 Senate report on the Act stated that such a use of funds would be contrary to the intent of the Act. A number of grantees or subgrantees that received funds under the Act were organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations. A lawsuit challenging the validity of the Act was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by a group of federal taxpayers, members of the clergy, and a religious organization. These parties, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claimed that the Act, on its face and as applied, violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court held that (1) although the Act had a valid secular purpose, it was unconstitutional on its face because it had the direct and immediate effect of advancing religion insofar as religious organizations were involved in carrying out the programs and purposes of the Act, and (2) the Act was unconstitutional as applied, because funds had been provided to ""pervasively sectarian"" institutions, with the effect of directly advancing religion and leading to entanglement of church and state (657 F Supp 1547).",Civil Rights,Freedom of Speech

"The petitioners contended that their state court convictions and sentences violated their constitutional right to a trial by jury. One of the petitioners, convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment, was tried in an Oregon state court pursuant to an Oregon constitutional provision authorizing a jury to convict in a noncapital case if 10 of the 12 jurors supported conviction; the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed his conviction (238 Or 208, 390 P2d 923, cert den 380 US 923, 13 L Ed 2d 807, 85 S Ct 921); and his request for postconviction to return on the ground that the jury had unconstitutionally been permitted to return a verdict of guilty although the members did not unanimously favor that verdict, was denied by the Oregon Supreme Court. The other petitioner was sentenced by an Illinois state court to three concurrent one-year terms for criminal contempt; he unsuccessfully exhausted his remedies on direct appeal and sought postconviction relief in the Illinois state courts; and he instituted habeas corpus proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, contending that it was unconstitutional to sentence him for criminal contempt without giving him a jury trial, but the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied him relief, holding that a jury trial was not required for state criminal contempt proceedings.

"In the district court, respondents introduced evidence that petitioners issued certificates of conformance falsely stating that their work was completed in compliance with U.S. Navy specifications for generator sets needed in the construction of Navy guided missile destroyers and that petitioners presented invoices for payment to the prime contractor shipyards. Respondents, however, did not introduce the invoices that the shipyards submitted to the Navy. The district court found respondents' evidence legally insufficient under the FCA, but the Sixth Circuit held that claims under 31 U.S.C.S. _ 3729(a)(2), (3) did not require proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by the Government; instead, proof of an intent to cause such a claim to be paid by a private entity using Government funds was sufficient. Contrary to the Sixth Circuit, the Court held that under _ 3729(a)(2) respondents were required to prove that petitioners intended that the false statement be material to the Government's decision to pay or approve the false claim. Similarly, under _ 3729(a)(3) respondents were required to show that petitioners agreed to make use of the false statement to achieve this end.",Defense,Military Contractors
"A complaint with respect to alleged disparity in railroad rates was dismissed by the Interstate Commerce Commission solely on the ground that the disparity was justified on the basis of competition by water carriers. (325 ICC 621.) Upon review of the Commission's order of dismissal, the District Court for the Western District of Washington set aside the order for lack of evidence to support the existence of water competition sufficient to justify the rate disparity, and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings with instructions to grant relief to the complainant in accordance with the opinion entered by the court.

"In a suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to enjoin New Jersey officials from enforcing regulations applicable to payments under the federally financed program for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, a three-judge court enjoined the enforcement of regulations (1) denying AFDC benefits to the extent that a family's income exceeds a state-specified ceiling, without deduction from the family's income for the income disregards specified by the federal statute, and (2) authorizing payments direct to vendors who provide goods or services to beneficiaries (Poverty Law Reporter 11,983).",Social Welfare,
"California statutes governing the establishing or relocating of new-car dealerships require that an automobile manufacturer, in order to add dealerships to the market areas of its existing franchisees, must notify the existing franchisees as well as the California New Motor Vehicle Board and must obtain the Board's approval only if an existing franchisee files a protest with the Board, which must notify the manufacturer that the proposed dealership may not be opened pending a hearing on, and determination of, the merits of the protest. After existing franchisees had protested General Motors Corporation's proposed opening of a dealership in one market area and its proposed relocation of another dealership into another market area, the manufacturer and the proposed franchisees instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A three-judge District Court held that the absence of a requirement in the California statutes for a hearing on the merits of a dealer protest before notifying a manufacturer under the statutes violated procedural due process requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment (440 F Supp 436).",Domestic Commerce,Corporate Management
"A student attending a Christian college in the State of Washington was suffering from a progressive visual condition which made him eligible for state vocational rehabilitation assistance to blind persons. He was studying to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director. He applied to a state agency for rehabilitation assistance consisting of payments for his education, but the agency denied him assistance on the ground that his training constituted religious instruction for which the state constitution prohibited the use of public funds. The student sought judicial review of the agency's decision in the Spokane County Superior Court, which affirmed the agency's decision. The Washington Supreme Court, while also affirming the agency's decision, expressly reserved judgment on the state constitutional issue, but held that providing aid to the student would violate the establishment clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, since the provision of financial assistance by the state to enable someone to become a pastor, missionary, or church youth director would have the primary effect of advancing religion (102 Wash 2d 624, 689 P2d 53).",Education,Special Education
