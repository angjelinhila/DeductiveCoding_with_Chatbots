"With respect to bankruptcy proceedings, 11 USCS _ 523(a)(8) provides that student-loan debts guaranteed by governmental units are not included in a federal bankruptcy court's general discharge order unless excepting the debt from the order would impose an ""undue hardship"" on the debtor. Also, in order to discharge such a student-loan debt, Rules 7001(6), 7003, and 7004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure generally require (1) the filing by a debtor of an ""adversary proceeding"" against such a governmental unit; and (2) the service of a summons and a complaint. An individual who had a student-loan debt filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS __ 701 et seq.) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Although the individual received a general discharge, the individual had not listed her student loans in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the general discharge did not cover them. In September 1999, the individual reopened her bankruptcy petition for the limited purpose of seeking a determination by the Bankruptcy Court that her student loans were dischargeable. As prescribed by the Bankruptcy Rules, the individual filed a complaint against various defendants. Later, the individual filed an amended complaint in which she included, as an additional defendant, a Tennessee governmental corporation that was an assignee holder of the individual's student-loan debt. The complaint and the amended complaint were served, along with a summons, on each of the named parties.",Domestic Commerce,Bankruptcy
"An individual applied for a patent on a method for updating alarm limits during catalytic conversion processes. The only novel feature of the method was a mathematical formula. The patent claim covered a broad range of potential uses of the method, but did not cover every conceivable application of the formula.

"A schism developed in a local church affiliated with a hierarchical church organization when a majority of the local church's members voted to separate from the church organization, while others opposed the separation. The majority faction united with another denomination, while the minority, although remaining on the church rolls for three years, conducted its religious activities elsewhere. A dispute arose over the ownership of church property, held either in the name of trustees for the local church or simply in the name of the church itself. Under the policy of the national church, the government of the local church is committed initially to its ""session"", but the actions of this assembly or ""court"" are subject to the review and control of higher church courts. In response to the schism, a higher church court appointed a commission to investigate the dispute, and this commission ruled that the minority faction constituted the ""true congregation"" of the local church, thereby withdrawing all authority from the majority faction. The majority took no part in this inquiry, and did not appeal the ruling to a higher church tribunal. Eventually, representatives of the minority faction brought a class action in a Georgia state court to establish their right to exclusive possession and use of the local church property, but the trial court, purporting to apply the state's ""neutral principles of law"" approach to church property disputes, granted judgment for the majority. This approach entails settling property disputes on the basis of the language of the deeds, the terms of the local church charters, the state statutes governing the holding of church property, and the provisions in the constitution of the general church concerning the ownership and control of church property. The Supreme Court of Georgia, holding that the trial court had correctly stated and applied Georgia law, and rejecting the minority's challenge based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, affirmed (241 Ga 208, 243 SE2d 860).",Civil Rights,Freedom of Speech

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order and remanded for consideration of whether the Board's General Counsel had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would not have been fired had it not been for his union activities (674 F2d 130).",Labor,Fair Labor Standards
"Although 38 USCS 1662(a)(1) normally requires veterans who are entitled to G.I. Bill educational benefits to use such benefits within 10 years following discharge or release from active duty, a veteran may obtain an extension of the 10-year delimiting period if the veteran was prevented from using the benefits earlier because of a physical or mental disability which was not the result of the veteran's own ""willful misconduct."" Two cases involved the interaction of (1) a Veterans' Administration (VA) regulation ( 38 CFR 3.301(c)(2)), which has the effect of defining ""willful misconduct"" to include ""primary"" alcoholism--alcoholism unrelated to an underlying psychiatric disorder; (2) 38 USCS 211(a), which generally bars judicial review of VA decisions under any law administered by the VA providing benefits for veterans; and (3) 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USCS 794), which requires that federal programs not discriminate against handicapped individuals solely because of their handicap. In each of the two cases, a veteran requested from the VA an extension of the 10-year limit, on the ground that the veteran had been disabled by alcoholism during the relevant period, but the VA--determining that the veteran's alcoholism constituted willful misconduct under 3.301(c)(2)--denied the request, and the veteran's administrative appeal was unsuccessful. In the first case, the veteran then sought judicial review in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, which held that (1) 211(a) did not bar judicial review of the veteran's claim that 3.301(c)(2) violated 504; (2) alcoholism was a handicap within the meaning of 504; and (3) the VA had therefore discriminated on the basis of handicap in violation of 504 (606 F Supp 391). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, without reaching the merits, reversed, and expressed the view that 211(a) barred judicial review of the 504 claim (791 F2d 226). In the second case, the veteran sought judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which held that (1) 211(a) did not bar judicial review of the veteran's claim that 3.301(c)(2) violated 504; and (2) 301(c)(2) was invalid as contrary to 504 (596 F Supp 1317). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1) found that 211(a) did not foreclose judicial review of the particular veteran's 504 claim, but (2) reversed on the merits, on the ground that 3.301(c)(2) did not violate 504 (253 App DC 126, 792 F2d 194).",Education,Higher Education

"The Secretary was authorized to accept land in trust for an Indian tribe, and ""Indian"" was defined in 25 U.S.C.S. _ 479 as a member of a ""recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdiction."" The State contended that the word ""now"" referred to the date of enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), of which _ 479 was a part, and that the tribe was not federally recognized at that time. The Secretary argued that ""now"" referred to the time when the Secretary accepted the land in trust, and that the tribe was federally recognized at that time. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the term ""now under Federal jurisdiction"" unambiguously referred to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted and, because the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction at that time, the Secretary lacked the authority to take the land into trust. At the time of enactment of the IRA, the ordinary meaning of the word ""now"" was ""at this moment"" or ""at the time of speaking,"" which clearly referred in _ 479 solely to matters existing contemporaneous with the enactment of the IRA, and such definition aligned with the natural reading of the word within the context of the IRA.",Public Lands,Indigenous Affairs

"The Kansas City area's health system agency (HSA), a private, non-profit corporation, federally funded under the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act (NHPRDA; 42 USCS 300k et seq.), determined that there was a surplus of hospital beds in the Kansas City area and announced that it would not approve any addition of acute-care beds in area hospitals. As a result of this announced policy, the petitioner, a private, acute-care community hospital in the Kansas City area, did not seek the HSA's approval of its construction. However, prior to the completion of construction, the petitioner sought to become a participating member of the respondent insurers' health insurance plan. The respondents refused to accept the petitioner as a participating member, because of the respondents' policy barring participation in their insurance plan by any new hospital which could not show that it was meeting a clearly evident need for health-care services in the Kansas City area. In determining that the petitioner had not satisfied this requirement, the respondents relied on the petitioner's failure to obtain the HSA's approval for construction. Claiming that the respondents' refusal to accept the petitioner as a participating member put the petitioner at a competitive disadvantage, the petitioner filed suit against the respondents in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The petitioner claimed that the respondents had violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1, 2) by refusing to deal with the petitioner and by conspiring with the HSA. Holding that Congress intended that actions taken by private parties with the intention of aiding implementation of the NHPRDA would be immune from the antitrust laws, the District Court granted judgment for the respondents (479 F Supp 1012).

"In 1996, a defendant was indicted for murder and other crimes, and the defendant was convicted on all charges in a South Carolina trial court. During the trial's sentencing phase, the prosecutor (1) presented evidence that the defendant had made a knife while in prison and had taken part in an escape attempt with plans to hold a guard hostage; (2) elicited evidence of the defendant's sadism at an early age and his current desires to kill anyone who irritated him; (3) expressed the hope that the jurors would ""never in [their] lives again have to experience . . . [b]eing some thirty feet away from such a person"" as the defendant; and (4) spoke of the defendant, in the closing argument, as a ""dangerous"" ""bloody"" ""butcher."" Defense counsel requested the trial judge to instruct the jurors that the defendant would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial court denied the requested instruction, on the ground that the state's evidence went to the defendant's character and characteristics rather than to future dangerousness. The jury found five statutory aggravating circumstances and returned a recommendation of death, to which the trial court acceded. The Supreme Court of South Carolina, in affirming the convictions and sentences, expressed the view that the rule of Simmons v South Carolina, supra, was inapposite because (1) life without the possibility of parole was not the only legally available sentence alternative to death, and (2) future dangerousness was not at issue (343 SC 350, 540 SE2d 851).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"A contractor on a federal project in Montana instituted an action in a Montana state court, alleging that Montana's one percent gross receipts tax upon contractors of public, but not private, construction projects violated the Federal Constitution because it discriminated against the federal government and the companies with which it dealt. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Montana sustained the tax, finding that the distinction between public and private contractors was consistent with the supremacy clause (Art VI, cl 2) and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (161 Mont 140, 505 P2d 102). Subsequently, the contractor instituted a second state court action regarding certain tax payments different from those involved in its initial action, but the Montana Supreme Court, finding the second claim to be no different from the first, affirmed dismissal of the complaint on the grounds of collateral estoppel and res judicata (166 Mont 260, 531 P2d 1327). Thereafter, the United States District Court for the District of Montana resumed consideration of an action which the United States had brought approximately one month after the public contractor had initiated its first suit, the District Court having continued the case brought by the government to challenge the constitutionality of the gross receipts tax pending resolution of the state-court litigation. Concluding that the United States--which, had (1) required the contractor to file the action, (2) reviewed and approved the complaint, (3) paid the attorneys' fees and costs, (4) directed the appeal in such case to the Montana Supreme Court, (5) appeared and submitted a brief as amicus curiae in the Montana Supreme Court, (6) directed the filing of a notice of appeal to the United States Supreme Court, and (7) effectuated the contractor's abandonment of that appeal on advice of the Solicitor General--was not bound by the prior judgment of the Montana Supreme Court upholding the tax, the three-judge District Court held that the gross receipts tax volated the supremacy clause (437 F Supp 354).",Macroeconomics,Tax Code
"An unmarried pregnant woman who wished to terminate her pregnancy by abortion instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes, which prohibited abortions except with respect to those procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, were unconstitutional. She also sought an injunction against their continued enforcement. A physician, who alleged that he had been previously arrested for violations of the Texas statutes and that two prosecutions were presently pending against him in the state courts, sought and was granted permission to intervene. A separate action, similar to that filed by the unmarried, pregnant woman, was filed by a married, childless couple, who alleged that should the wife become pregnant at some future date, they would wish to terminate the pregnancy by abortion. The two actions were consolidated and heard together by a three-judge District Court, which held that (1) the unmarried, pregnant woman and the physician had standing to sue, (2) the married, childless couple's complaint should be dismissed because they lacked standing to sue, (3) abstention was not warranted with respect to a declaratory judgment, (4) the right to choose whether to have children was protected by the Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment, (5) the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their face, because they were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and (6) the application for injunctive relief should be denied under the abstention doctrine (314 F Supp 1217).

"An attorney who was representing the plaintiff in a copyright infringement action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York joined with another attorney to form a law partnership during pretrial litigation in such action. Subsequent to the formation of the partnership, all court papers in the case were signed both with the law partnership's name and by the plaintiff's original attorney as ""a member of the firm."" At trial, the court granted the defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the plaintiff's claim that documents purporting to grant the defendants an option to develop the plaintiff's copyrighted work commercially had been forged by one of the defendants; the jury returned a verdict against the plaintiff on all remaining claims. The defendants thereafter moved for sanctions, against the plaintiff's law firm and against both members of the firm individually, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which provides, among other things, that a court shall impose an appropriate sanction upon the ""person who signed"" a pleading, motion, or other paper which was not ""well grounded in fact""--on the ground that the forgery claim had no basis in fact and had not been investigated sufficiently by counsel. The District Court granted the motion and imposed a monetary sanction under Rule 11 against the law firm (111 FRD 637). Two weeks later, the law firm was dissolved, and the attorney who had not signed any of the court papers moved in the District Court to relieve the firm of the sanction. The District Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, ruling that (1) half of the sanction would be shifted from the firm to the signing attorney, since the firm did not exist during a portion of the litigation and was thus not fully responsible for the Rule 11 violations, but (2) the remaining half of the sanction could be imposed, pursuant to Rule 11, on both the individual attorney and the law firm on whose behalf he signed the papers (650 F Supp 684). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that nothing in the language of Rule 11 prohibited the imposition of sanctions on a signer's law firm, as well as on the individual attorney who signed an offending paper (854 F2d 1452).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"A defendant was charged, along with several others, in a single-count indictment with violating 18 USCS 1955 by participating in a gambling business involved with numbers betting and betting on horse races in violation of a specified Massachusetts statute. After the close of the government's case at the trial before the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the defendant moved for an acquittal, arguing that the government had failed to prove that there was a violation of the state statutory section as alleged in the indictment, since the statute cited, as construed by the state courts, did not prohibit numbers betting but applied only to games of competition such as horse races. The District Court denied the motion, but after the defendants had rested, granted a motion to strike all evidence of numbers betting, apparently believing such action to be required by the indictment's failure to set forth the proper state statute. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence of his connection with horse-betting activities. The court granted this motion. On appeal by the government, under 18 USCS 3731, from the order excluding the numbers-betting evidence and from the judgment acquitting the defendant, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the judgment of acquittal and remanded the case for a new trial on the numbers-betting charge, holding that it had jurisdiction of the appeal from the dismissal of the numbers charge under the provision of 3731 authorizing government appeals from orders dismissing an indictment as to any one or more counts, since the District Court's action constituted a dismissal of the numbers charge, and that there was no double jeopardy bar to a new trial, since the defendant had voluntarily terminated the proceedings on the numbers portion of the count by moving, in effect, to dismiss it (548 F2d 1).",Domestic Commerce,Sports Regulation
"Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 lays out steps that a judge must take to ensure that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary. Rule 11(h)'s requirement that any variance from those procedures ""which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded"" is similar to the general ""harmless-error"" rule in Rule 52(a). However, Rule 11(h) does not include a plain-error provision comparable to Rule 52(b), which provides that a defendant who fails to object to trial error may nonetheless have a conviction reversed by showing among other things that plain error affected his substantial rights. After respondent Vonn was charged with federal bank robbery and firearm crimes, the Magistrate Judge twice advised him of his constitutional rights, including the right to be represented by counsel at every stage of the proceedings; Vonn signed a statement saying that he had read and understood his rights; and he answered yes to the court's questions whether he had understood the court's explanation of his rights and whether he had read and signed the statement. When Vonn later pleaded guilty to robbery, the court advised him of the constitutional rights he was relinquishing, but skipped the advice required by Rule (11)(c)(3) that he would have the right to assistance of counsel at trial. Subsequently, Vonn pleaded guilty to the firearm charge and to a later-charged conspiracy count. Again, the court advised him of the rights he was waiving, but did not mention the right to counsel. Eight months later, Vonn moved to withdraw his guilty plea on the firearm charge but did not cite Rule 11 error. The court denied the motion and sentenced him. On appeal, he sought to set aside all of his convictions, for the first time raising Rule 11. The Ninth Circuit agreed that there had been error and held that Vonn's failure to object before the District Court to the Rule 11 omission was of no import because Rule 11(h) subjects all Rule 11 violations to harmless-error review. Declining to go beyond the plea proceeding in considering whether Vonn was aware of his rights, the court held that the Government had not met its burden, under harmless-error review, of showing no effect on substantial rights, and vacated the convictions.",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code

Thereafter, the Commission, in separate proceedings, similarly approved the second railroad's proposed termination of other interstate train runs which connected with the runs involved in the first proceeding (333 ICC 720).
