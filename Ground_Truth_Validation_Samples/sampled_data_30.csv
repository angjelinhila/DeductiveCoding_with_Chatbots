"A private college declined to participate in direct institutional aid programs and in federal student assistance programs under which it would have had to assess students' eligibility and determine the amount of funds they should receive, but enrolled a large number of students who received Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOGs) through the Department of Education's Alternate Disbursement System, under which the Secretary of Education calculates awards and makes disbursements directly to eligible students. The Department concluded that the college was a recipient of federal financial assistance, and after the college refused to execute an assurance of compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 USCS 1681 et seq.), which, inter alia, prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, the Department initiated administrative proceedings to declare the college and its students ineligible to receive BEOGs. The administrative law judge found in favor of the Department and entered an order terminating assistance to the college. The college and four of its students brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which concluded that the students' BEOGs constituted federal financial assistance to the college, but held that the Department could not terminate aid due to the college's refusal to execute the assurance. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the Department could terminate the students' BEOGs to force the college to execute an assurance of compliance (687 F2d 684).",Civil Rights,Gender Discrimination

"A Michigan statute prohibited corporations from using corporate treasury funds for independent expenditures in support of or in opposition to any candidate in elections for state office. An ""independent"" expenditure was defined as one not made at the direction or under the control of another person, or to a committee working for or against a candidate. The statute allowed corporations to make such independent expenditures from only segregated funds used solely for political purposes. The statute exempted from its coverage expenditures by a broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical or publication for any news story, commentary, or editorial--in the regular course of publication or broadcasting--in support of or in opposition to a candidate for elective office. The validity of the statute was challenged by the Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit corporation with 8,000 members, three-quarters of whom were for-profit corporations. The chamber's general treasury was funded through annual dues required of all members. The chamber's purposes, as set out in its bylaws, included not only making expenditures for political purposes and performing other political activities, but also adding such activities as compiling and disseminating information relating to social, civic, and economic conditions, training and educating its members, and promoting ethical business practices. Although the chamber administered a segregated political fund, the chamber sought to use its general treasury funds for a newspaper advertisement in favor of a specific candidate for the Michigan House of Representatives. The chamber brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan against state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the statute. The District Court held that the statute was valid under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment and under the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment (643 F Supp 397). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversing on appeal, held that the statute, as applied to the chamber, violated the First Amendment because (1) the chamber was a ""nontraditional"" corporation formed for essentially ideological purposes and to disseminate economic and political ideas, (2) the chamber's expenditures did not pose the threat or appearance of corruption, and (3) there was thus no compelling state interest that justified the infringement of the chamber's freedom of speech (856 F2d 783).",Government Operations,Political Campaigns
"Certain Negro and white residents of Cairo, Illinois, instituted a class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois against the Magistrate and an Associate Judge of the Alexander County Circuit Court. Purporting to represent a class consisting of persons who participated in boycotts of local merchants and other activities to achieve racial equality, Negroes who suffered racial discrimination in the application of the county's criminal justice system, and persons who were unable to afford bail, or counsel and jury trials in city ordinance violation cases, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants, in administering criminal justice in the county, selectively discriminated against the plaintiffs and members of the class by illegal bond, sentencing, and jury fee practices, thus depriving the plaintiffs and members of the class of their rights under the Constitution and under civil rights statutes (42 USCS 1981-1983, 1985). The District Court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction to issue the injunctive relief prayed for, and on the ground that the defendants were immune from suit for their official acts, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that if the plaintiffs proved their allegations, appropriate injunctive relief should be fashioned by the District Court (468 F2d 389).",Civil Rights,Minority Discrimination

"Although ""laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas"" are not patentable subject matter under ¬¨√ü101 of the Patent Act, Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185, ""an application of a law of nature ... to a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection,"" id., at 187. But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patenteligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words ""apply it."" See, e.g., Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 71-72. It must limit its reach to a particular, inventive application of the law. Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. When ingested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the bloodstream. Because patients metabolize these drugs differently, doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular patient's dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective. The patent claims here set forth processes embodying researchers' findings that identify correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision. Each claim recites (1) an ""administering"" step-instructing a doctor to administer the drug to his patient-(2) a ""determining"" step-telling the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patient's blood-and (3) a ""wherein"" step-describing the metabolite concentrations above which there is a likelihood of harmful side-effects and below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and informing the doctor that metabolite concentrations above or below these thresholds ""indicate a need"" to decrease or increase (respectively) the drug dosage. Petitioners Mayo Collaborative Services and Mayo Clinic Rochester (Mayo) bought and used diagnostic tests based on Prometheus' patents. But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and market its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus sued Mayo contending that Mayo's test infringed its patents. The District Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena-namely, the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopurine drugs-and therefore are not patentable. The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligible under the Circuit's ""machine or transformation test."" On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. __, which clarified that the ""machine or transformation test"" is not a definitive test of patent eligibility, id., at -__, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclusion.",Domestic Commerce,Copyrights and Patents
"After protracted litigation in the Interstate Commerce Commission and the federal courts, which, insofar as relevant, involved the increase of railroad rates for recyclable materials, a group of law students and other environmental groups filed, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the instant lawsuit against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission as defendants, wherein the nation's railroads intervened as defendants. The plaintiffs claimed that the Commission's decision not to suspend a surcharge pending its investigation was made without preparing an environmental impact statement or considering environmental issues, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 USCS 4321 et seq.); that the pre-existing rate structure discriminated against recyclables; and that the across-the-board rate surcharge had unfortunate consequences to the environment in that use of recyclable materials would be inhibited and use of virgin materials encouraged; the complaint sought to compel the Commission to suspend the rate surcharge and to enjoin the railroad from collecting it. A three-judge District Court set aside the Commission's order terminating a general revenue proceeding without declaring unlawful the rate increases as to the recyclables; the Court directed the Commission to reopen the proceeding, prepare a better environmental impact statement, hold hearings and reconsider, in the light of the new statement, its determination not to declare unlawful the rate increases applicable to recyclables (371 F Supp 1291).",Environment,General Environment
"Two local Presbyterian churches, which had voted to withdraw from the Presbyterian Church in the United States, the hierarchical general church organization, because of the latter's alleged departure from its original doctrines and tenets, instituted actions, consolidated for trial, in the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, to enjoin the general church from trespassing on property of the local churches. The trial court denied the general church's motion to dismiss, and its cross claim for injunctive relief, which had been made on the ground that civil courts were without power to determine whether the general church had departed from its doctrines, and the question whether the general church had substantially abandoned its original doctrines was submitted to a jury for determination. A verdict was returned for the local churches, and the trial court entered judgment for the local churches on the theory that under state law, an implied trust of local church property for the benefit of the general church had terminated because of the general church's substantial departure from its original doctrines.

"A group of railroads proposed a seasonal increase in the rates for shipment of grain and soybeans under 202 of the Railroad Reorganization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (recodified as 49 USCS 10727).

One month after the rates were filed, and eight days after receiving the protest, the Commission issued an order declining either to suspend or to investigate the legality of the rates. Immediately after the order was entered, two judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted an ex parte application for a temporary stay and enjoined the Commission from permiting the tariff to go into errect, but the court dissolved its stay eight days later and the new rates went into effect. Two months after the seasonal tariff had expired, the Court of Appeals held that the Commission had begun an investigation but had then erroneously terminated it without adequately investigating the charges of patent illegality and without supporting its decision with appropriate findings and conclusions (570 F2d 1349).",Transportation,Railroad Travel

"A military reservist worked for an oil refinery which operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which scheduled its employees to work 5 8-hour days in a row weekly, but in a different five-day sequence each week, and which, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, allowed an employee, with the acquiescence of his foremen and if the change would not require the payment of overtime, to exchange shifts with another employee. The reservist-employee had to attend training with his unit one weekend a month, and on a number of weekends he was required to attend training on days he was scheduled to work at the refinery. In most instances he was unable to exchange shifts with another employee, and while his employer provided him with leaves of absence to attend training, as required by 38 USCS 2024(d), it did not pay him for the hours he did not work, nor did it take steps to permit him to make up those hours by working outside his normal schedule. The employee brought an action in the United States Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the employer, alleging that it had violated 2024(d) and another provision of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 USCS 2021(b)(3)) which provides that any employee of a private employer ""shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.""

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, determining that the employer had met the requirements of 2024(d), and holding that 2021(b)(3) merely requires that reservists be treated equally or neutrally with their fellow employees without military obligations and that the employer had taken no discriminatory action that was prescribed by that provision (613 F2d 641).",Labor,Fair Labor Standards

"After designing a keyholder and applying for a patent to protect its design, the designer negotiated a contract with a company for the manufacture and sale of the keyholder. In one part of the contract the company agreed to pay royalties to the designer based on sales of the designer's putative invention in return for the company's having the ""exclusive right to make and sell keyholders of the type shown in [the designer's patent] application,"" and in another part of the contract, embodied in a separate document, the parties agreed that if the patent application were ""not allowed within five (5) years,"" the company would pay a reduced royalty on sales of the designer's keyholder ""so long as [the company] continue[s] to sell same."" When the designer failed to obtain a patent on the keyholder within the five years specified in the agreement, the company, which had begun manufacture and sale of the designer's keyholder, asserted its contractual right to reduce royalty payments. Shortly thereafter, the designer's application for a patent was finally rejected on the ground that the keyholder was not patentable. The company continued to pay reduced royalties to the designer for 14 years after denial of the patent application, but ultimately, after competitors began the manufacture and sale of similar keyholders, brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, asserting that the royalty agreement was unenforceable because state law, which might otherwise make the contract enforceable, was preempted by federal patent law. The District Court held that the agreement had no relation to whether or not a patent were granted and ruled that the company was obliged to pay royalties under the contract so long as it manufactured the keyholder (425 F Supp 600). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed on appeal, holding that the contract between the designer and the company became unenforceable once the designer failed to obtain a patent, and that imposing a continuing obligation on the company to pay royalties would be contrary to the federal policy favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain (567 F2d 757).",Domestic Commerce,Copyrights and Patents
