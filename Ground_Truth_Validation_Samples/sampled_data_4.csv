"In connection with an investigation of alleged interstate transportation of obscene materials, a federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia issued subpoenas duces tecum to three corporations--the first of which distributed sexually oriented paperback books, magazines, and videotapes, the second of which distributed adult materials, and the third of which sold books, magazines, and videotapes. All three corporations were based in New York and were wholly owned by the same person. The subpoenas sought a variety of corporate books and records as well as copies of 193 videotapes that the videotape distributor had shipped to retailers in the Eastern District of Virginia. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied the motions of all three corporations to quash the subpoenas, and, after the corporations still refused to comply with the subpoenas, the District Court found each corporation in contempt. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (1) upheld the subpoenas for the videotape distributor's business records and remanded the motion to quash the subpoena for that corporation's videotapes, and (2) quashed the subpoenas for the business records of the other two corporations (884 F2d 772). In quashing the subpoenas, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because there was no evidence in the record that either of the two corporations had ever shipped materials into, or otherwise conducted business in, the Eastern District of Virginia, and because any evidence concerning matters outside Virginia would most likely be inadmissible on relevancy grounds at any trial that might occur, the subpoenas failed to meet the requirement--established in a prior Supreme Court case with respect to subpoenas issued in the trial context--that any documents subpoenaed under Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum in federal criminal proceedings, must be admissible as evidence at trial.",Law and Crime,Court Administration
"A special grand jury investigated certain commodity futures transactions, and a defendant who was never indicted eventually pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act (7 USCS 6c(a)(A)). Eight months after the plea, the government filed a motion under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for disclosure of grand jury transcripts and documents to the Internal Revenue Service for its use in an audit to determine the defendant's civil income tax liability. Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) provides that disclosure of grand jury materials may be made when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.

"These cases presented questions as to the proper scope of judicial review of the Atomic Energy Commission's procedures with regard to the licensing of nuclear power plants. In one of the cases (No. 76-419), the Commission had granted a license to operate a nuclear power plant following a full, adjudicatory hearing in which it had excluded the issue of environmental effects of fuel reprocessing. Subsequently, after rulemaking proceedings which included notice and hearings, but which did not utilize full adjudicatory procedures, the Commission issued a ""spent fuel cycle rule"" and concluded that since the environmental effects of the uranium fuel cycle had been shown to be relatively insignificant, it was unnecessary to apply the rule to the licensee's reports submitted for the operating license prior to the rule's effective date or to final environmental statements for which draft environmental statements had been circulated for comment prior to the effective date. On appeal by certain intervenors from both the license and the rulemaking proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the rule and remanded the license determination for further proceedings, holding that in the absence of effective rulemaking proceedings, the Commission must deal with the environmental impact of fuel reprocessing and disposal in individual licensing proceedings, and that the rulemaking proceedings were inadequate (178 App DC 336, 547 F2d 633). In the other case (No. 76-528), the Commission had granted a permit for the construction of two nuclear reactors following extensive hearings, the examination of a report by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the issuance of a final environmental impact statement. Thereafter, revised guidelines were issued by the Council on Environmental Quality requiring consideration in impact statements of energy conservation as one of the alternatives to a proposed project. The Commission rejected a request by certain intervenors to reopen the permit proceedings in order to consider energy conservation alternatives, stating that a threshold test would have to be met by the intervenors before the Commission would consider such alternatives. On appeal by the intervenors from the grant of the permit, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the Commission's decision, holding that the environmental impact statement was fatally defective for failure to examine energy conservation as an alternative to the construction of the reactors, that the Commission's decision not to consider energy conservation on the basis of its threshold test was arbitrary and capricious, and that the Advisory's Committee report was inadequate and should have been sent back for further elucidation, understandable to a layman (178 App DC 325, 547 F2d 622).",Environment,Drinking Water
"This case involves a dispute between Florida and Georgia concerning the proper apportionment of interstate waters. Florida brought an original action against Georgia alleging that its upstream neighbor consumes more than its fair share of water from interstate rivers in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin. Florida claims that Georgia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s overconsumption of Basin waters caused low flows in the Apalachicola River which seriously harmed Florida‚Äö√Ñ√¥s oyster fisheries and river ecosystem. The first Special Master appointed by the Court to assess Florida‚Äö√Ñ√¥s claims recommended dismissal of Florida‚Äö√Ñ√¥s complaint. The Court disagreed with the Special Master‚Äö√Ñ√¥s analysis of the threshold question of redressability, and remanded for the Special Master to make definitive findings and recommendations on several issues, including: whether Florida had proved any serious injury caused by Georgia; the extent to which reducing Georgia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s water consumption would increase Apalachicola River flows; and the extent to which any increased Apalachicola flows would redress Florida‚Äö√Ñ√¥s injuries. Florida v. Georgia, 585 U. S. ___. Following supplemental briefing and oral argument, the Special Master then reviewing the case produced an 81-page report recommending that the Court deny Florida relief.

"Iraq was designated a state sponsor of terrorism but contended that the President properly waived the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity pursuant to _ 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA), 117 Stat. 559, 579 (2003). The victims argued that the presidential authority to waive the application of statutes to Iraq to aid in the reconstruction of Iraq did not extend to the terrorism exception, and that the victims' actions were filed prior to enactment of the EWSAA. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that Iraq was no longer subject to suit in federal court despite its designation as a sponsor of terrorism. The waiver authority under the EWSAA clearly extended to the terrorism exception as a provision of law which stripped sovereign immunity from foreign nations which supported terrorism, and the President expressly waived the exception with respect to Iraq, thus restoring Iraq's immunity. Further, the waiver authority was not limited to statutes imposing sanctions upon Iraq, and the waiver removed present jurisdiction over Iraq regardless of when the victims suffered their injuries or filed their lawsuits.",International Affairs,Specific Country

At the commencement of the trial, the defender moved for a continuance, but this motion was denied. Thereafter the defendants dismissed the defender and renewed motions for separate counsel and for a continuance. These motions were also denied.

The action was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, which declared the claimants' water rights, but did not adjudicate the priority of such rights among the claimants, and enjoined the defendants from impeding the full natural flow of the San Joaquin River unless within a reasonable time and at its own expense the United States or the districts should build 10 small dams for the purpose of keeping the water at a level equivalent to the natural flow or of simulating it at a flow of 2,000 feet per second.

"Four federal prisoners at the District of Columbia Jail, after escaping from confinement and remaining at large for periods of time of from one month to three and one-half months, ultimately were captured by federal authorities and charged with violations of 18 USCS 751(a), which delineates the offense of escape from federal custody. At the joint trial of three of the prisoners in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the defendants sought to assert duress or necessity as a defense to their escapes by adducing evidence as to the jail's physical conditions and the conduct of its guards, but the District Court, consistently throughout the trial, stressed to the defendants that in order to sustain such defense they would have to introduce some evidence that they had attempted to surrender or engaged in equivalent conduct once they had freed themselves from the oppressive conditions they had described as existing in the jail. Ultimately, the District Court refused to instruct the jury on duress on the ground that the three prisoners had failed as a matter of law to present evidence sufficient to suggest such a defense because they had not turned themselves in after they escaped and the jury, after being instructed to disregard the evidence concerning conditions at the jail, convicted the three prisoners. The fourth prisoner also was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violating 751(a). During his trial, the District Court ruled that absent testimony as to what the defendant had done between the time of his escape and his recapture, the prisoner could not present evidence of allegedly inhumane conditions at the jail. Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded for new trials as to each of the defendants, ruling that since 751(a) required the government to prove that a particular defendant had left federal custody voluntarily, without permission, and with an intent to avoid confinement, the trial courts should have allowed the juries to consider evidence of coercive conditions in determining whether the defendants had formulated the requisite intent to sustain a conviction under 751(a), that since escape as defined by 751(a) was a continuing offense as long as an escapee was at large, an escapee, under normal circumstances, had to present evidence of coercion to justify his continued absence from custody as well as his initial departure, and that in view of the indictments against the defendants having been for fleeing or escaping at a certain time and not for leaving and staying away from custody and in view of the trial court's instructions having given the impression that the defendants were being tried only for leaving the jail and not for failing to return at a later date, neither the defendants nor the juries had been apprised that the escapes in question were continuing offenses, such failure amounting to a violation of the defendants' right to a jury trial (190 App DC 142, 585 F2d 1087 and 190 App DC 185, 585 F2d 1130).",Government Operations,Capital City
"A defendant was convicted in a state court on charges of burglary, assault, and murder. After the murder conviction was set aside, a prosecutor proposed to the defendant's attorney that in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of accessory after a felony murder, the prosecutor would recommend a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently with the burglary and assault sentences. When the defendant's attorney notified the prosecutor that the defendant accepted the offer, the prosecutor told him that a mistake had been made, withdrew that offer, and proposed instead that in exchange for the guilty plea he would recommend a sentence to be served consecutively with the defendant's other sentences. The defendant rejected the new offer and elected to stand trial, but after a mistrial was declared, he accepted the second offer, and the state trial judge then imposed in accordance with the plea bargain a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences. After exhausting his state remedies, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the United States District Court dismissed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that fairness precluded the prosecution's withdrawal of the plea proposal once the defendant accepted it (707 F2d 323).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"After the owner and lessee of land on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, consulted with the Army Corps of Engineers regarding a plan for the development of a lagoon on their land known as Kuapa Pond, the Corps acquiesced in proposals by the lessee to dredge a channel so that the pond, which was separated from a navigable bay and the Pacific Ocean by a barrier beach, could be made into a marina joined to the bay. After the dredging operation was completed and millions of dollars had been invested in the development of a marina-style community of over 20,000 persons around the pond, a dispute arose between the developers and the Corps concerning whether authorization from the Corps had to be obtained for future construction, filling, or excavation in the marina, and whether the owner and lessee were precluded from denying the public access to the pond on the theory that the improved pond was ""navigable water of the United States."" The United States then brought an action against the owner and lessee in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii regarding the dispute. The District Court ruled that although the pond was navigable water of the United States, and, as such, subject to the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause of the Constitution (Art 1, 8, cl 3), it was not navigable for the purpose of defining the scope of the federal navigational servitude imposed by the commerce clause, and that the government lacked the authority to open the pond to the public without payment of compensation to the owner (408 F Supp 42). On appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court's conclusion that the pond fell within the scope of Congress' regulatory authority, but reversed the District Court's holding that the navigational servitude of the United States did not require public access to the pond (584 F2d 378).",Transportation,Maritime Transportation

This corporation, three of its officers, and another individual brought, against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), a suit challenging the federal constitutionality of _ 441b and its implementing regulations as applied to the corporation. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, granting summary judgment to the corporation, held _ 441b unconstitutional as applied to the corporation as to direct contributions and independent expenditures (137 F Supp 2d 648). A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed (278 F3d 261). After the Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc, the FEC petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari solely as to the constitutionality of the ban on direct contributions.",Government Operations,Political Campaigns
