"In proceedings in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina to desegregate a North Carolina school system, which proceedings included cases that had been removed from state courts and consolidated for hearing, a three-judge court was convened to consider the constitutionality of the North Carolina antibusing statute. Both parties in the instant case argued to the three-judge panel that the statute was constitutional. The District Court entered a judgment declaring a portion of the antibusing statute unconstitutional, and enjoining its enforcement (312 F Supp 503).",Civil Rights,Minority Discrimination
"Two Arizona county medical societies formed two ""foundations for medical care"" organized for the purpose of promoting fee-for-service medicine and to provide the community with a competitive alternative to existing health insurance plans. The foundations performed three primary activities including establishing the schedule of maximum fees that participating doctors agreed to accept as payment in full for services performed for patients insured under plans approved by the foundations. The state of Arizona filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the two county medical societies and foundations alleging that they were engaged in illegal price-fixing conspiracies in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1). The state moved for partial summary judgment after conducting a limited amount of pretrial discovery, and the District Court denied the motion but certified for interlocutory appeal the question of whether the foundations' membership agreements, which contained the promise to abide by maximum fee schedules, are illegal per se under 1 of the Sherman Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order refusing to enter partial summary judgment, holding that the question could not be answered without evaluating the actual purpose and effect of the agreement at a full trial (643 F2d 553).",Domestic Commerce,Corporate Management
"During a preflight inspection of an air carrier's plane, an aircraft mechanic employed by the carrier and licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discovered that an axle sleeve was scarred and grooved, which condition could cause the plane's landing gear to fail. The mechanic recommended to his supervisor that the sleeve be replaced, but the supervisor ordered that the sleeve be sanded and returned to the plane. This was done, and the plane flew as scheduled. At the end of his shift, the mechanic refused to sign the maintenance record to certify, as required by FAA regulation, that the repair had been performed satisfactorily and that the plane was fit to fly. The supervisor suspended the mechanic pending a termination hearing, and the mechanic returned home and called the FAA to report the problem with the sleeve. At the termination hearing, the carrier accused the mechanic of insubordination for refusing to sign the maintenance record, in violation of a provision of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the carrier and the mechanic's union that a mechanic could be required to sign records in connection with work performed. The mechanic was terminated for insubordination. The next day, the FAA seized the sleeve and initiated a comprehensive investigation against the carrier. After the mechanic appealed his termination under the CBA grievance procedures, the carrier offered to reduce the mechanic's punishment to suspension without pay, but warned the mechanic that any further failure to perform the mechanic's duties could result in discharge. Without responding to such offer or further pursuing his grievance under the CBA, the mechanic filed two actions in a Hawaii state trial court, one against the carrier and the other against managerial officers of the carrier. In both actions, the mechanic claimed that his discharge violated (1) the public policy expressed in the Federal Aviation Act (49 USCS Appx 1301 et seq.) and implementing regulations; and (2) a Hawaii ""whistleblower"" statute, which forbade an employer from discriminating against an employee because the employee reported a violation of state or federal law to a public body. The Hawaii state trial court ultimately ruled that the mechanic's claims were pre-empted by the Railway Labor Act (RLA) (45 USCS 151 et seq.), which covered the airline industry and, under 45 USCS 153 First (i), set up a mandatory arbitral mechanism to handle the class of disputes, established by 45 USCS 151a and known as ""minor"" disputes, that grow out of grievances or out of the interpretation and application of CBAs. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Hawaii, reversing, expressed the view that the mechanic's state tort claims were not pre-empted by the RLA (74 Haw 235, 842 P2d 634; 74 Haw 648, 847 P2d 263).",Transportation,Air Travel

"A seaman who had moved from Mississippi to Pennsylvania was injured in the course of his employment aboard a tug operating on the Delaware River. After receiving medical treatment in Pennsylvania and New York, the seaman returned to Mississippi. Thereafter, the seaman filed an action in Louisiana Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans against the employer and sought relief under (1) the Jones Act (46 USCS Appx 688), which authorizes a seaman injured in the course of employment to bring an action for damages at law; and (2) general maritime law for unseaworthiness, wages, and maintenance and cure. Pursuant to a Louisiana code of civil procedure provision, the doctrine of forum non conveniens is unavailable in Jones Act and federal maritime law cases brought in Louisiana state courts. The Civil District Court, in granting the employer's motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, held that the court was bound to apply such doctrine by federal maritime law. On appeal, the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Fourth District affirmed (580 So 2d 1091). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, reversing, expressed the view that the Louisiana provision regarding forum non conveniens was not pre-empted by federal maritime law (595 So 2d 615).",Labor,Worker Safety

"This case presented the question whether an unsuccessful tender offeror in a contest for control of a corporation had an implied cause of action for damages either under 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USCS 78n(e)), which prohibits fraud in connection with tender offers, or under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-6 ( 17 CFR 240.10b-6), which prohibits issuers whose stock is in the process of distribution from market-tampering by purchasing either the stock or rights to purchase the stock until the distribution has been completed. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the successful tender offeror, the target corporation, and a corporation that had served both as the successful tender offeror's underwriter and the target corporation's investment adviser, the plaintiff alleging that the defendants had violated 14(e) and Rule 10b-6 during the contest for control of the target corporation. After protracted litigation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the plaintiff had standing to sue for damages under 14(e) and Rule 10b-6, and that contrary to the District Court's conclusion, the plaintiff had established actionable violations by the defendants (480 F2d 341). After remand to the District Court to determine damages and to enter injunctive relief, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on the damages issue and calculated the plaintiff's damages without further remand (516 F2d 172).",Domestic Commerce,Securities & Commodities
"A natural gas company having six rate zones with rate differentials filed with the Federal Power Commission, pursuant to 4(d) of the Natural Gas Act (15 USC 717c(d)), increased its rate schedules and included a 7 percent overall return on its net investment. The Commission severed for prior hearing and determination the issue of the reasonableness of the 7 percent rate of return, and denied the gas company's motion to decide simultaneously the issue as to cost of service and allocation of rates among the company's rate zones. It then found that the 7 percent return was excessive, and that a 6 1/8 percent rate of return was just and reasonable. Prior to determining the issue as to cost of service and allocation of rates, it issued an interim order requiring the gas company to file reduced rates retroactively to the effective date of the increased rates and to refund the differences collected since that time. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit set aside the Commission's order, holding that the 6 1/8 percent return was just and reasonable but that the Commission abused its discretion in issuing the interim rate-change and refund order before deciding the issue as to cost allocation among the company's rate zones. 293 F2d 761.",Energy,Natural Gas & Oil
"An employer in Missouri granted a female employee a leave of absence on account of her pregnancy but made no guaranty of reinstatement. When the employee sought to return to work, she was told that there were no positions open. The employee filed a claim for unemployment benefits which was ultimately denied by the state's Labor and Industrial Relations Commission on the ground that Missouri law disqualifies claimants who have left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to their work or their employer. On review, the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri reversed, holding that the Missouri law was inconsistent with a provision of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 USCS 3304(a)(12)) which states that unemployment compensation shall not be denied under state law solely on the basis of pregnancy. The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed, holding that the state law was consistent with 3304(a)(12) since it did not single out pregnancy for unfavorable treatment (688 SW2d 344).",Civil Rights,Gender Discrimination
"The petitioner, a Negro, applied for a job as a pilot with an interstate air carrier, but his application was rejected by the carrier's headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The petitioner then made complaint to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission established under a Colorado statute which, in its pertinent part, made it an unfair employment practice for an employer to refuse to hire any person otherwise qualified, because of race, creed, color, national origin, or ancestry. The Commission issued a cease and desist order against the carrier, but on review the District Court in and for the City and County of Denver set aside the Commission's findings and dismissed petitioner's complaint, holding that the act could not constitutionally be extended to cover the flight crew personnel of an interstate carrier because it would impose an undue burden upon commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and because the field of law concerning racial discrimination in the interstate operation of carriers was pre-empted by the Railway Labor Act, the Civil Aeronautics Act, and Federal Executive Orders.

"A clause of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) permits states to adopt or continue in force any state law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety until such time as the Secretary of Transportation has adopted a regulation covering the subject matter of such state requirement (45 USCS 434). Regulations promulgated by the Secretary (1) establish the general terms under which states may use federal aid to eliminate highway hazards such as those at grade crossings (23 CFR Part 924); (2) require that states must employ warning devices which conform to standards set out in a manual of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ( 23 CFR 646.214(b)(1)); (3) require that a project for the improvement of a grade crossing must either include automatic gates or receive federal approval as to the type of warning device to be installed if federal funds participate in the installation of the warning devices ( 23 CFR 646.214(b)(3) and 646.214(b)(4)); and (4) set maximum train speeds for various classes of track ( 49 CFR 213.9(a)). In 1988, the driver of a truck was killed in a collision with a train at a grade crossing in Georgia, at which crossing the state had installed motion-detection circuitry but not a crossing gate. The driver's widow brought a diversity wrongful death action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the company that owned and operated the train. Among the allegations in the widow's action were claims that the company was negligent under Georgia law for (1) failing to maintain adequate warning devices at the crossing, and (2) operating the train at an excessive speed. The District Court, expressing the view that both claims were pre-empted under the FRSA, granted summary judgment for the company (742 F Supp 676). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the allegation based on the train's speed was pre-empted, but that the claim based on the absence of proper warning devices was not (933 F2d 1548).",Transportation,Railroad Travel

The local school district involved had not elected to furnish free books for grades 1 through 6 at the time the action was instituted, and the plaintiffs, as indigent recipients of public assistance in the school district, contended that the education laws, as applied to their children, who were students in the elementary grades, created a wealth classification violative of the equal protection clause.

"Certain individuals filed a patent application for a process for molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products. The individuals claimed that their process insured the production of molded articles which are properly cured. Although it is possible by using well-known time, temperature, and cure relationships to calculate by means of an established mathematical equation when to open the molding press and remove the cured product, the individuals argued that the industry had not been able to obtain uniformly accurate cures because the temperature of the press could not be precisely measured, making it difficult to do the necessary computations to determine cure time. The individuals characterized their contribution to the art as residing in the process of constantly measuring the actual temperature inside the mold, with these temperature measurements being automatically fed into a computer which recalculates the cure time by use of the mathematical equation and ultimately signals a device to open the press at the correct moment. Concluding that the individuals' claims defined and sought protection of a computer program, the patent examiner rejected those claims on the sole ground that they were drawn to nonstatutory subject matter under 35 USCS 101, which provides for the issuance of patents to whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. The Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals agreed with the examiner, but the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed, noting that a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory because a computer is involved (602 F2d 982).",Domestic Commerce,Copyrights and Patents
"At a time when receipt of such magazines was legal under both federal and Nebraska law, a Nebraska farmer ordered and received from a bookstore two magazines containing photographs of nude preteen and teenage boys. After Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984 (18 USCS 2251 et seq.)--which, in 18 USCS 2252(a)(2)(A), criminalized the receipt through the mails of sexually explicit depictions of children--postal inspectors found the farmer's name on the bookstore mailing list, and, as a result, the Postal Service sought to explore the farmer's willingness to place a mail order that would violate 2252(a)(2)(A), by mailing him letters from three fictitious organizations--which letters discussed (1) protection and promotion of sexual freedom and freedom of choice, and (2) funding of lobbying efforts by catalog sales--and from a bogus pen pal who stated an interest in materials depicting the sexual activities of young men. The farmer responded to the letters by answering questionnaires and expressing interest in the organizations' goals. Twenty-six months after the Postal Service had commenced sending the mail, the Customs Service, using the name of a fictitious organization, mailed the farmer an advertisement for photographs of young boys engaging in sex, in response to which advertisement the farmer placed an order that was never filled. The Postal Service, posing as yet another fictitious organization that sold sexually explicit materials, then mailed the farmer a letter that called concerns about pornography hysterical nonsense and decried international censorship. After the farmer ordered and received from this fictitious organization, through the mail, a pornographic magazine depicting young boys engaged in various sexual activities, the farmer was arrested. A search of his home revealed the magazines bought from the bookstore and the materials sent by the government during its investigation, but revealed no other materials indicating that the farmer collected or was actively interested in child pornography. At the farmer's trial in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska on charges of violating 2252(a)(2)(A), the jury was instructed on the farmer's entrapment defense and the farmer was convicted.

"Assuming, without deciding, that the school's coach was speaking as a citizen about matters of public concern, the association could impose only those conditions on such speech that were necessary to managing an efficient and effective state-sponsored high school athletic league. Hard-sell tactics directed at middle school students could lead to exploitation, distort competition, and foster an environment in which athletics were prized more highly than academics. The association's rule discouraged precisely the sort of conduct that might lead to those harms, any one of which would detract from a high school sports league's ability to operate efficiently and effectively. Thus, the Supreme Court found that the First Amendment did not excuse the school from abiding by the same anti-recruiting rule that governed the conduct of its sister schools. As to the school's due process claim, even accepting the questionable holding that the association's closed-door deliberations were unconstitutional, any due process violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the school identified nothing investigators shared with the association's board that the school did not already know.",Civil Rights,Freedom of Speech

On the second point, it was contended that the government had omitted substantial assets, in cash, stock, and stock sale proceeds, in its establishment of the taxpayers' opening net worth; that the government had failed to investigate the taxpayers' explanation of sources of certain assets; that the government had not shown the taxpayers' net worth increases to be attributable to taxable income; and that the government had not proved the taxpayers' wilfulness.",Government Operations,Tax Administration

"Three persons who were convicted after separate trials on unrelated charges in Ohio state courts and who failed to comply with an Ohio court rule mandating contemporaneous objections to jury instructions, challenged the constitutionality of those instructions in federal habeas corpus proceedings brought in United States District Courts in Ohio under 28 USCS 2254. Their trials occurred after the effective date of an Ohio statute which placed the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt upon the prosecution and provided that ""the burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense is upon the accused, but before the Ohio Supreme Court, in an unrelated proceeding, held that the statute changed Ohio's traditional rule requiring defendants to carry the burden of proving the affirmative defense of self-defense by a proponderence of the evidence and placed only the burden of production, not persuasion, on the defendant, so that once the defendant produced some evidence of self-defense, the prosecutor had to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The appropriate Ohio Courts of Appeal affirmed the convictions of two of the petitioners before that decision, and the Ohio Supreme Court declined to review their convictions. Neither of those petitioners challenged the self-defense instruction in their appeals. When the third petitioner appealed his conviction to the intermediate appellate court, he relied upon the intervening decision to challenge the self-defense instruction given at his trial, but the court rejected the challenge as having been waived by the petitioner's failure to comply with the contemporaneous objection rule, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. The District Courts denied each petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that (1) Wainwright v Sykes (1977) 433 US 72, 53 L Ed 2d 594, 97 S Ct 2497, did not preclude consideration of the third petitioner's constitutional claims despite Wainwright's holding that a state prisoner, barred by procedural default from raising a constitutional claim on direct appeal, could not litigate that claim in federal habeas corpus proceedings under 28 USCS 2254 without showing cause for and actual prejudice from the default, and (2) the instructions given at that petitioner's trial violated due process.

"The National Labor Relations Board has a practice of excluding from collective bargaining units only those confidential employees with a ""labor nexus"" while rejecting any claim that all employees with access to confidential information are beyond the reach of the definition of ""employee"" in 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 152(3)). In keeping with this practice, the Board--finding that the personal secretary to a corporation's general manager and chief executive officer, did not assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine, and effectuate management policies in the field of labor relations--ruled that the secretary was protected by the Act (29 USCS 151 et seq.) and that her discharge following her signing of a petition for reinstatement of a fellow employee constituted an unfair labor practice. The Board also ordered reinstatement of the secretary (236 NLRB 1616). The employer sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and the Board cross-petitioned for enforcement. Ultimately, that court refused to enforce the Board's order, holding that all secretaries working in a confidential capacity, without regard to labor relations, must be excluded from the coverage of the Act (603 F2d 25), and that the evidence in the record failed to support a finding that the secretary in question did not come within the court's broader definition of confidential secretary (627 F2d 766). In another case, the National Labor Relations Board, reviewing an employer's refusal to bargain with a unit of employees which the employer contended included confidential employees not subject to the National Labor Relations Act, accepted the view that none of the challenged employees was a confidential employee under the Board's labor nexus test, and issued a bargaining order after finding that the employer's refusal to bargain violated the Act (244 NLRB 485). On the employer's petition for review and the Board's cross-petition for enforcement, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals once again denied enforcement, noting that the Board's labor nexus test which the court had rejected in its earlier decision had also been utilized in the case before it.

In reaching its conclusion, the Sixth Circuit disregarded the overwhelming evidence of guilt that supported the contrary conclusion of a Tennessee court. This approach plainly violated Congress‚Äö√Ñ√¥ prohibition on disturbing state-court judgments on federal habeas review absent an error that lies ‚Äö√Ñ√∫‚Äö√Ñ√≤beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚Äö√Ñ√π Shinn v.
