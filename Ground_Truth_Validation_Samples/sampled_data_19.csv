"In 1958, the state of Vermont made a tax assessment against a solvent taxpayer, and approximately 3 1/2 months later, the United States made a tax assessment against the same taxpayer. The applicable state statute was virtually identical to the provisions of 26 USC 6321 and 6322 that if a person fails to pay a tax after demand, the amount shall be a lien in favor of the government upon all property and rights to property belonging to such person, and that the lien shall arise at the time the assessment is made. After the federal assessment, the state obtained a judgment in a state court action against the taxpayer and a bank which held property of the taxpayer. In 1961, the United States brought the present action in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont to foreclose the federal lien against the taxpayer's property held by the bank. The District Court held that the state lien had priority (206 F Supp 951), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (317 F2d 446).",Macroeconomics,Tax Code
"Respondent Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license. Because he had been convicted of the same offense three times before, he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maximum 4-year prison term. The prosecutor sent Frye‚Äö√Ñ√¥s counsel a letter, offering two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90- day sentence. Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they expired. Less than a week before Frye‚Äö√Ñ√¥s preliminary hearing, he was again arrested for driving with a revoked license. He subsequently pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced to three years in prison. Seeking postconviction relief in state court, he alleged his counsel‚Äö√Ñ√¥s failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testified that he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of the offer. The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. Specifically, the court found that defense counsel had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and concluded that Frye had shown that counsel‚Äö√Ñ√¥s deficient performance caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor.",Law and Crime,Court Administration
"Immigrant migrant farmworkers instituted an action against certain farm labor contractors in a California Superior Court, alleging that the defendants had refused continued employment to the plaintiffs because of a surplus of labor resulting from the defendants' violation of a California statute which provides that no employer shall knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the country if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers. The Superior Court dismissed the complaint, holding that the statute was unconstitutional as encroaching upon the comprehensive scheme of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS 1101 et seq.), enacted by Congress in the exercise of its exclusive power over immigration. The Court of Appeals of California, Second Appellate District, affirmed (40 Cal App 3d 976, 115 Cal Rptr 444).",Immigration,Immigration

"A longshoreman employed by a stevedoring company which had contracted to perform stevedoring services for a vessel, ""with every care and due dispatch to the satisfaction"" of her owners, brought suit against the owners in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, based on diversity of citizenship, for unseaworthiness and negligence resulting in injuries sustained in unloading 1,000-pound bales of burlap from the vessel when two one-inch steel bands around a bale of burlap broke as the bale was being lifted by the bands, causing the bale to drop onto bales consigned to another port, bound halfway across the hatch, and strike the employee. The owners impleaded the stevedoring company, alleging that it was negligent in its manner and method of unloading, and asking indemnity from it in case the owners were held liable to the longshoreman. The trial court instructed the jury that the stevedoring company was obliged by the contract to unload the cargo with the utmost care, that if the stevedoring company did not unload the cargo in a reasonably safe manner, the stevedoring company was liable to the owners, and that it was for the jury to determine whether the stevedoring company was negligent in leaving in the place where it had been stowed the part of the cargo consigned to another port. In answer to special interrogatories, the jury found that the vessel was unseaworthy, that the owners were negligent, and that the owners' fault did not arise out of any failure of the stevedoring company to perform its contractual obligations. The District Court thereupon entered judgment in favor of the longshoreman against the owners, and in favor of the stevedoring company on the owners' claim for indemnity. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the judgment in favor of the longshoreman and against the owners on the issue of negligence, but reversed the judgment in favor of the stevedoring company on the ground that negligence in unloading by hooks attached to the bands, or by improperly stowing the bales consigned to another port, necessarily carried with it the conclusion that the stevedoring company had breached its contractual obligation to the owners.

"A corporation sought a permit from Mississippi officials to distribute in Mississippi milk and milk products processed in the corporation's Louisiana plant, but the permit was denied under a Mississippi regulation excluding milk from another state unless such other state accepted Mississippi milk on a reciprocal basis--Louisiana having refused to enter into a reciprocal agreement with Mississippi. The corporation then instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, alleging that the Mississippi regulation violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Art I, 8, cl 3).

"In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under ¬¨√ü111 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. ¬¨√ü7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to issuing a final rule by May 2012. The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated efforts to regulate greenhouse gases. Two groups of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners here. One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts. According to the complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the Nation. By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs asserted, the defendants‚Äö√Ñ√¥ emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law. All plaintiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually. The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticiable political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed. On the threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing. On the merits, the court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫federal common law of nuisance,‚Äö√Ñ√π relying on this Court‚Äö√Ñ√¥s decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v.

"These two consolidated cases, for which a single petition for certiorari was filed, presented the issue of whether 26 USCS 7403 empowers a federal District Court to order the sale of the family home in which a delinquent taxpayer had an interest at the time he incurred his indebtedness, but in which the taxpayer's spouse, who did not owe any of that indebtedness, also had a separate homestead right as defined by state law. In the first case, the federal government filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas a suit seeking to force the sale of a delinquent taxpayer's home to satisfy the tax indebtedness he incurred before his death. At the time, the former spouse of the delinquent taxpayer occupied the house as her homestead with her new husband. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the spouse on her claim that the federal tax liens could not defeat her state-created right not to have her homestead subjected to a forced sale under 26 USCS 7403. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirmed on the homestead issue, holding that if a homestead interest is under state law a property right possessed by the nontaxpayer spouse at the time the lien attaches to the taxpayer spouse's interest, the federal tax lien may not be foreclosed against the homestead property for as long as the non-taxpayer spouse maintains his or her homestead interest under state law (649 F2d 1117). In the second case, the Internal Revenue Service issued assessments against a delinquent taxpayer, and also separately against the delinquent taxpayer and his spouse for their joint tax liability. The husband and wife then obtained a divorce, entering into a property settlement whereby the husband would convey his interest in the house, which had been destroyed by fire, to his wife. The wife and a trustee then brought suit in a state court to quiet title to the house, to enjoin demolition of that house, and to remove the federal tax liens on the house. The United States removed the suit to the same federal District Court as in the first case, which granted summary judgment for the government on its counterclaim to sell the property under 7403. The same Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part, finding that the proceeds of the sale of the house (the parties agreeing to sell the house, but stipulating that the case should be treated as if it were not sold) could be foreclosed on to collect the joint liability of the husband and wife, but holding that the government could not reach the proceeds to satisfy the husband's tax indebtedness. The Court of Appeals remanded for a factual determination of whether the wife had abandoned her homestead interest (649 F2d 1128).",Domestic Commerce,Consumer Finance
"In a state prosecution of defendant for burglary, the trial court ruled inadmissible a statement made by defendant to the police when he was arrested at his home, because defendant had not been advised of his Miranda rights, but admitted into evidence a written confession defendant made later that day at the police station after he had been advised of and waived his Miranda rights. The Oregon Court of Appeals, reversed, finding there was an insufficient break in the stream of events between the inadmissible statement and the written confession to insulate the latter statement from the coercive impact of the unconstitutionally obtained statement (61 Or App 673, 658 P2d 552).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
"An Illinois corporation installed a boiler system at the Ohio facility of a Delaware corporation. Six years later, the Delaware corporation, claiming that the boiler did not meet contract specifications and had been improperly installed, brought a diversity action against the Illinois corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which action charged the Illinois corporation with breach of contract. The Illinois corporation moved for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by Ohio's 4-year statute of limitations. The Delaware corporation argued that the statutory period had not run, pointing to Ohio statutory provisions which (1) tolled the statute of limitations for any period that a person or corporation is not ""present"" in the state and (2) required that a foreign corporation, in order to be ""present"" in Ohio, must appoint an agent for service of process, which appointment operates as a consent to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts. The Illinois corporation responded (1) that the tolling statute was invalid under the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), or alternatively (2) that the Delaware corporation had been ""present"" in Ohio because it had been continually subject to the ""long arm"" jurisdiction of the Ohio courts. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Illinois corporation, because it found that the tolling statute imposed a constitutionally impermissible burden on interstate commerce.

"A claimant in the state of Washington applied for Social Security disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income benefits, alleging that she was disabled by an inner ear dysfunction, dizzy spells, headaches, an inability to focus her eyes, and flat feet. The claimant, aged 45, had attended business college for 2 years, had received real-estate training, and had been employed as a travel agent and a real-estate salesperson. The Washington Department of Social and Health Services found that she was not disabled. This finding was upheld by an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals of the Social Security Administration (SSA), who evaluated the claim under a five-step sequential procedure for determining disability. This procedure, established under a federal regulation ( 20 CFR 404.1520, 416.920), allows a claimant to be found not disabled at ""step two"" if, without considering vocational factors such as the claimant's age, education, and work experience, it is determined that the claimant does not have any impairment or combination of impairments that significantly limits his or her physical or mental ability to do basic work activities ( 20 CFR 404.1520(c), 416.920(c)). Without considering vocational factors, the ALJ concluded at ""step two"" that although the claimant suffered from episodes of dizziness or visual problems, her medical impairments were not severe under the terms of 20 CFR 404.1520(c), 416.920(c). The SSA's Appeals Council denied the claimant's request for review, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington affirmed the denial of her claim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that a provision of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 423(d)(2)(A)) which provides that a claimant is deemed to be disabled if his or her impairment or impairments are of such severity that the claimant not only is unable to do his or her previous work, but cannot, considering his or her age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work, requires that not only medical but also vocational factors be considered in determining disability. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals invalidated 20 CFR 404.1520(c) on its face (774 F2d 1365).",Social Welfare,Elderly Assistance

"A defendant was convicted in a state court on charges of burglary, assault, and murder. After the murder conviction was set aside, a prosecutor proposed to the defendant's attorney that in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of accessory after a felony murder, the prosecutor would recommend a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently with the burglary and assault sentences. When the defendant's attorney notified the prosecutor that the defendant accepted the offer, the prosecutor told him that a mistake had been made, withdrew that offer, and proposed instead that in exchange for the guilty plea he would recommend a sentence to be served consecutively with the defendant's other sentences. The defendant rejected the new offer and elected to stand trial, but after a mistrial was declared, he accepted the second offer, and the state trial judge then imposed in accordance with the plea bargain a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences. After exhausting his state remedies, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the United States District Court dismissed.

"Under a provision of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 USCS 152(11), an employee is a ""supervisor"" if the employee has the authority, in the interest of the employer, to engage in specified activities--including responsible direction of other employees--where the exercise of such authority requires the use of independent judgment. With respect to the supervisory status of nurses, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) adhered to a test under which (1) a nurse's direction of less-skilled employees, in the exercise of professional judgment incidental to the treatment of patients, was not authority exercised ""in the interest of the employer"" for purposes of 152(11); and (2) only a nurse who in the course of employment used independent judgment to engage in an activity relating to another employee's job status or pay could qualify as a supervisor. Four licensed practical nurses employed at a nursing home in Ohio had various responsibilities that pertained to directing the work of aides. The NLRB's General Counsel issued a complaint alleging that the corporation which owned and operated the nursing home had committed unfair labor practices in disciplining the four nurses. The corporation alleged, among other things, that the nurses in question were supervisors and therefore not protected under the NLRA. An NLRB administrative law judge, ruling that the corporation had committed an unfair labor practice with respect to some of the disciplinary actions, concluded that (1) the nurses' focus was on the well-being of the residents rather than of the employer; and (2) for this reason and others, the nurses in question were not supervisors (306 NLRB 68). The NLRB, in affirming in pertinent part, expressed agreement that the nurses were employees covered by the NLRA (306 NLRB 63, 139 BNA LRRM 1175, 1991-92 CCH NLRB 17070). However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in vacating the NLRB's order, concluded that (1) the nurses in question were supervisors for purposes of the NLRA; and (2) the NLRB's test for determining the supervisory status of nurses was inconsistent with the NLRA (987 F2d 1256).",Labor,Fair Labor Standards

"After petitioner Lozman towed his floating home into a slip in a marina owned by the city of Riviera Beach, he became an outspoken critic of the City‚Äö√Ñ√¥s plan to use its eminent domain power to seize waterfront homes for private development and often made critical comments about officials during the public-comment period of city council meet- ings. He also filed a lawsuit alleging that the City Council‚Äö√Ñ√¥s approval of an agreement with developers violated Florida‚Äö√Ñ√¥s open-meetings laws. In June 2006 the Council held a closed-door session, in part to discuss Lozman‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lawsuit. He alleges that the meeting‚Äö√Ñ√¥s transcript shows that councilmembers devised an official plan to intimidate him, and that many of his subsequent disputes with city officials and employees were part of the City‚Äö√Ñ√¥s retaliation plan. Five months after the closed-door meeting, the Council held a public meeting. During the public-comment session, Lozman began to speak about the ar- rests of officials from other jurisdictions. When he refused a coun- cilmember‚Äö√Ñ√¥s request to stop making his remarks, the councilmember told the police officer in attendance to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫carry him out.‚Äö√Ñ√π The officer handcuffed Lozman and ushered him out of the meeting.

Lozman claims that his arrest was to retali- ate for his lawsuit and his prior public criticisms of city officials.

The District Court instructed the jury that, for Lozman to prevail on his claim of a retaliatory arrest at the city council meeting, he had to prove that the arresting officer was motivated by impermissible animus against Lozman‚Äö√Ñ√¥s protected speech and that the officer lacked probable cause to make the arrest. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that any error the District Court made when it instructed the jury to con- sider the officer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s retaliatory animus was harmless because the jury necessarily determined that the arrest was supported by probable cause when it found for the City on Lozman‚Äö√Ñ√¥s other claims.

A department regulation required that public benefits for a child, including the Social Security benefits in question, be used on behalf of the child to help pay for the child's foster care costs. Accordingly, the department generally (1) credited the Social Security benefits that the department received to a special account for the beneficiary child, and (2) debited the account to pay foster care providers. A class action was brought in Washington's Superior Court, Okanogan County, on behalf of foster children who received Social Security benefits and for whom the state had acted or sought to act as representative payee.

Two months later, a grand jury began to investigate an alleged conspiracy to influence the outcome of the third party's case, and when two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents questioned the accused, the accused lied to the agents about both his participation in the case and his knowledge of the wiretap. The accused was convicted in Federal District Court of disclosing a wiretap, in violation of 18 USCS 2232(c), and, because of his false statements to the FBI investigators, of endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice, in violation of 18 USCS 1503. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed both convictions, holding that (1) 2232(c) required the disclosure of a pending wiretap authorization or an authorization that had not expired, because the purpose of 2232(c) was to thwart interference with the possible interception of the wiretap of which an accused has knowledge, and in this case the interception was impossible because the authorization for it had expired when the accused disclosed its existence, and (2) the accused had not interfered with a pending judicial proceeding under 1503, because the grand jury investigating the conspiracy had not authorized or directed the FBI investigation, and merely uttering false statements did not ""corruptly influence"" within the meaning of 1503 (21 F3d 1475).",Law and Crime,Criminal & Civil Code
