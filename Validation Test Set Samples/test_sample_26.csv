summary
"In concluding that the state courts misapplied California's rule on whether ""some evidence"" supported finding that an inmate was unsuitable for parole, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either that federal habeas relief was available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the ""some evidence"" standard was required by the federal Due Process Clause. Neither assumption was correct. Whatever liberty interest existed was created by California law. There was no right under the Federal Constitution to parole, and the States had no duty to offer parole. Under Cal. Penal Code Ann. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 3041, 3041.5 (2010), the inmates were allowed to speak at their parole hearings, to contest the evidence against them, given access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied; the Due Process Clause did not require more. California's ""some evidence"" rule was not a substantive federal requirement. Nor was it a federal concern whether the ""some evidence"" rule was correctly applied. California's ""some evidence"" rule would not be pronounced to be a component of the liberty interest, as a mere error of state law was not a denial of due process."
"A union had not met the noncommunist affidavit requirements of 9(h) of the amended National Labor Relations Act when it filed with the National Labor Relations Board a charge of unfair labor practices against an employer, based upon its violations of 8(a) (1) and (3) of the act. However, those requirements were met before the Board issued its complaint. A cease and desist order of the Board was challenged by the employer on the ground that the Board could not issue a valid complaint based on a charge by a union which was not in compliance with 9(h)."
"A Kansas jury sentenced respondent Sidney Gleason to death for killing a co-conspirator and her boyfriend to cover up the robbery of an elderly man. A Kansas jury sentenced respondents Reginald and Jonathan Carr, brothers, to death after a joint sentencing proceeding. Respondents were convicted of various charges stemming from a notorious crime spree that culminated in the brutal rape, robbery, kidnaping, and execution-style shooting of five young men and women. The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the death sentences in each case, holding that the sentencing instructions violated the Eighth Amendment by failing ""to affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating circumstances need only be proved to the satisfaction of the individual juror in that juror's sentencing decision and not beyond a reasonable doubt."" It also held that the Carrs' Eighth Amendment right ""to an individualized capital sentencing determination"" was violated by the trial court's failure to sever their sentencing proceedings."
"These two, consolidated cases presented the question of whether 42 USCS 1983 authorizes a convicted person to assert a claim for damages against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at his criminal trial. In the first case, an individual was convicted in state court of burglarizing a house trailer. He then filed a 1983 complaint against a member of a police force, alleging that the police officer had violated his constitutional right to due process by committing perjury in the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction. In the other case, two individuals were jointly tried and convicted of sexual assault in a state court. They subsequently brought a civil action under 1983 against a different police officer, alleging that he had deprived them of their constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. They alleged that, by giving false testimony suggesting that they had been able to harmonize their stories before making exculpatory statements to police, the officer had prejudicially diminished the credibility of those statements. In the first case the United States District Court granted the police officer's motion for summary judgment, and in the second case the United States District Court dismissed the complaint. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that, in litigation brought under 1983, all witnesses--police officers as well as lay witnesses--are absolutely immune from civil liability based on their testimony in judicial proceedings (663 F2d 713)."
"A federal taxpayer, who had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain from the government information concerning the detailed expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency, instituted an action for injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that certain provisions concerning secrecy of expenditures under the Central Intelligence Agency Act (50 USCS 403 et seq.)--particularly the provisions (50 USCS 403j(b)) allowing the Agency to account for its expenditures solely on the certificate of the Director--violated Article I, 9, cl 7 of the Constitution, which provides that a regular statement of account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time. The District Court, concluding that the plaintiff lacked standing, dismissed the action, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that although the plaintiff did not directly attack an appropriation act since he could not question an appropriation about which he had no knowledge, nevertheless he had standing to sue because there was a sufficient nexus between his status as a taxpayer and the constitutional limitation of Article I, 9, cl 7 on Congress' taxing and spending power under Article I, 8 of the Constitution (465 F2d 844)."
"A government contractor's private employee whose security clearance was held in 1959 to have been improperly revoked in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination ( Greene v McElroy, 360 US 474, 3 L ed 2d 1377, 79 S Ct 1400) obtained a Federal District Court order declaring the revocation not validly authorized and ordering that all rulings denying his security clearance be expunged. Basing his claim on a 1955 Department of Defense directive providing for monetary remuneration for the loss of earnings resulting directly from a suspension of clearance ""where a final determination is favorable to a contractor employee,"" he formally requested the Department of Defense to provide monetary restitution for his loss of earnings. The Department of Defense refused to grant restitution under the 1955 directive, but offered to consider the employee's claim under a 1960 directive issued after the claim had arisen and had been formally asserted, under which it was necessary that there be administrative determinations that he was entitled to an access authorization and that the revocation of the earlier security clearance was unjustified. The employee then brought suit against the United States in the United States Court of Claims, which ordered the proceedings suspended pending pursuit of administrative remedies by the Department of Defense."
"The licensors contended that the licensee paid the royalties demanded by the licensors and thus there was no constitutional case or controversy to support federal jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 2201. The licensee argued that it paid the royalties under protest to avoid the serious potential consequences of the licensors' threatened infringement action, and that the licensee was not required to actually suffer those consequences as a precursor to seeking judicial relief. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the licensee was not required, insofar as U.S. Const. art. III was concerned, to break or terminate its license agreement before seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court that the underlying patent was invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. The licensee's self-avoidance of imminent injury by paying the royalties was coerced by the threatened enforcement action of the licensors, and the coercive nature of the exaction of royalties preserved the licensee's right to recover the royalties paid or to challenge the legality of the licensors' demand for royalties."
"The state of Michigan, by regulation, placed certain restrictions on non-contact visits with prison inmates. With the exception of qualified members of the clergy and attorneys on official business, all visitors were required to be on an approved visitors list. The list could include an unlimited number of members of the prisoner's immediate family and ten other individuals the prisoner designated, subject to some restrictions. Minors under the age of 18 could not be placed on the list unless they were children, stepchildren, grandchildren or siblings of the inmate; a child authorized to visit had to be accompanied by an adult who was an immediate family member of the child or of the inmate or who was the legal guardian of the child; and if the inmate's parental rights were terminated, the child could not be listed as a visitor. An inmate could not place a former prisoner on the list unless the former prisoner was a member of the inmate's immediate family and the warden gave prior approval. Finally, prisoners who committed multiple substance-abuse violations were not permitted to receive any visitors except attorneys and members of the clergy; however, an inmate subject to this restriction could apply for reinstatement of visitation privileges after 2 years, subject to the warden's discretion. Prisoners, their friends, and their family members brought an action under 42 USCS _ 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against Michigan's department of corrections and the department's director, arguing that the restrictions upon visitation violated the Federal Constitution's First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The  [***163]  action was certified as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
"A pension plan negotiated in 1971 through collective bargaining between a Minnesota company and the union representing its employees provided that pensions were to be payable only from a fund established under the plan. The plan was funded on a deferred basis, and gave the company the sole right to terminate the plan at any time. In the event of termination, pensions were to remain at certain designated levels, with the company assuming liability for payments of $ 7 million in excess of the fund's assets. Shortly before the company's decision to terminate the plan in 1974, Minnesota enacted the Private Pension Benefit Protection Act which imposed a ""pension funding charge"" on any employer who ceased to operate a place of employment or pension plan. After the company was assessed a charge under the Act of approximately $ 19 million, it filed suit against the appropriate state official in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging that the Pension Act conflicted with the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 151 et seq.) insofar as the Pension Act interfered with the right of collective bargaining. Relying on Congressional intent as evidenced in the Federal Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act of 1958 (72 Stat 997, repealed in 1975)-- 10(a) of which provided that the Disclosure Act should not be construed to prevent any state from obtaining additional information relating to a pension plan ""or from otherwise regulating such plan,"" and 10(b) of which specified that the Disclosure Act did not exempt any person from liability under any present or future state law affecting the operation or administration of employee welfare or pension benefit plans--the District Court held that the Minnesota Pension Act was not preempted by federal law (412 F Supp 372). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the Pension Act was preempted by federal labor law insofar as it purported to override the terms of an existing pension plan arrived at through collective bargaining (545 F2d 599)."
"Seeking to enjoin the enforcement of an Illinois law prohibiting medical assistance payments for all abortions except those necessary for preservation of the mother's life on the ground that the provisions of the Social Security Act for the Medicaid program (42 USCS 1396 et seq.) required Illinois to provide coverage in its Medicaid plan for all medically necessary abortions whether or not the life of the pregnant woman was endangered, and on the ground that Illinois' funding of medically necessary services generally, but not medically necessary abortions, violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, physicians who performed medically necessary abortions for indigent women, a welfare rights organization, and an indigent pregnant woman who alleged that she desired an abortion that was medically necessary, but not necessary to save her life, brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the head of the state agency charged with administering Illinois' medical assistance programs. In its initial decision addressing the merits, the District Court permanently enjoined enforcement of the Illinois law insofar as it denied payment for medically necessary or medically indicated abortions, ruling that the provisions of the Social Security Act for the Medicaid program and implementing regulations required a state participating in the Medicaid program to provide funding for all medically necessary abortions, and noting that a state was not relieved of its independent obligations under the Social Security Act to provide Medicaid funding for all medically necessary abortions because of the so-called ""Hyde Amendment,"" whereby the United States Congress, in appropriations legislation (90 Stat 1418; 91 Stat 1153, 1323, 1460; 92 Stat 1567; 93 Stat 656, 923) placed limitations on the types of medically necessary abortions for which federal funds may be spent under the Medicaid program. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the Hyde Amendment allowed states participating in the Medicaid program to limit funding to the categories of abortions specified in Congress' appropriations legislation, and remanded to the District Court with directions that it resolve the federal constitutional questions which it had not reached, specifically, whether the Hyde Amendment, by limiting funds for abortions to certain circumstances even if such abortions were medically necessary, violated the Fifth Amendment (596 F2d 196). In subsequent proceedings on remand in which the United States intervened to defend the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, the District Court ruled that both the Illinois law and the Hyde Amendment violated the federal constitutional principle of equal protection (469 F Supp 1212)."
"Prior to Congress' enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (PL 104-104, 110 Stat 56), states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local telephone market to a local exchange carrier (LEC), which owned the various forms of equipment that constituted a local exchange network. The 1996 Act ended such state-granted monopolies and subjected incumbent LECs to various duties--including the obligation under 47 USCS 251(c) to share networks with competitors--that were intended to facilitate market entry. Under 251(c), a requesting carrier was permitted to obtain access to an incumbent's network by various means, such as (1) leasing elements of the incumbent's network ""on an unbundled basis,"" or (2) interconnecting the requesting carrier's own facilities with the incumbent's network. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules implementing the 1996 Act's local-competition provisions, several incumbent LECs and state commissions challenged some of these rules by filing petitions for review which were consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Court of Appeals concluded, among other matters, that (1) the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding (a) pricing ( 47 CFR 51.503 and 51.505), (b) state review of pre-existing interconnection agreements between incumbent LECs and other carriers ( 47 CFR 51.303), and (c) rural exemptions ( 47 CFR 51.405); (2) with respect to the FCC's primary ""unbundling"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.319), the FCC--in specifying the network elements available to requesting carriers--reasonably implemented the requirement of 47 USCS 251(d)(2) that the FCC consider whether access to proprietary elements was ""necessary"" and whether lack of access to nonproprietary elements would ""impair"" an entrant's ability to provide local service; (3) the FCC's rule forbidding incumbent LECs to separate already-combined network elements before leasing them to competitors ( 47 CFR 51.315(b)) had to be vacated as requiring access to those elements on a bundled rather than an unbundled--that is, physically separated--basis; and (4) the FCC's ""pick and choose"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.809)--enabling a competing LEC to demand access to any individual interconnection, service, or network element arrangement on the same terms and conditions that the incumbent LEC gave anyone else in an agreement approved pursuant to 47 USCS 252, but not obligating the competing LEC to accept the agreement's other provisions--had to be vacated as deterring the ""voluntarily negotiated agreements"" that the 1996 Act favored (120 F3d 753, 1997 US App LEXIS 18183). In a separate opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding dialing parity, that is, an arrangement enabling a new entrant's customers to make calls without having to dial an access code ( 47 CFR 51.205-51.215) (124 F3d 934, 1997 US App LEXIS 22343)."
"The United States sued to restrain violations of __ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by (1) five corporations which produce motion pictures and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates which distribute and exhibit films and own or control theatres, (2) two corporations which produce motion pictures and their subsidiaries which distribute films, and (3) one corporation engaged only in the distribution of motion pictures. The complaint charged that the first group of defendants conspired to and did restrain and monopolize interstate trade in the exhibition of motion pictures in most of the larger cities of the country and that their combination of producing, distributing and exhibiting motion pictures violated __ 1 and 2 of the Act. It also charged that all of the defendants, as distributors, conspired to and did restrain and monopolize interstate trade in the distribution and exhibition of films. After a trial, the District Court granted an injunction and other relief."
"The antifraud provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5 ( 17 CFR 240.10b-5)--a rule issued by the SEC pursuant to 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act) (15 USCS 78j(b))--generally prohibit, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, misleading statements of material fact. The representatives of one company had meetings and telephone conversations with the officers of another (the ""target"" company), concerning the possibility of a merger. In 1977 and 1978, during the pendency of these discussions, the target company made three public statements, the first of which denied that the company was engaged in merger ""negotiations,"" and the later two of which said, in effect, that the company knew of no company developments that would explain the abnormally high trading activity and price fluctuations in the company's stock. Later in 1978, however, the target company, on 3 succeeding days, (1) asked for a suspension of trading in its stock, (2) endorsed an offer by the first company for the target company's stock, and (3) publicly announced the approval of the offer. In the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, former target company shareholders who had sold their stock, after the first public denial and before the trading suspension, filed against the target company and its directors a class action which alleged that the company and its directors had issued three false or misleading public statements in violation of 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The District Court adopted a presumption of reliance by members of the proposed plaintiff class upon the public statements--a presumption that enabled the court to conclude that common questions of law or fact predominated over particular questions pertaining to individual plaintiffs--and, under Rules 23(a)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District Court, although limiting the proposed class somewhat, otherwise certified the plaintiffs' class. On the merits, however, the District Court granted summary judgment to the company and its directors, on the ground that the alleged misstatements were immaterial. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the class certification, but ordered the summary judgment on the merits to be reversed and remanded, and expressed the view that, under the circumstances, (1) the target company had the duty to disclose certain omitted facts about the merger discussions, and (2) the omitted facts were material (786 F2d 741)."
"In 1983, a Florida state court convicted a defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. A subsequently enacted Florida statute provide for lethal injection as a means of execution. Although the statute did not provide for any specific lethal-injection procedure, a Florida death row inmate's challenge to a particular three-drug sequence of injections was rejected by the Supreme Court of Florida in 2000. In December 2005, less than a month before the defendant's scheduled execution, the defendant challenged Florida's lethal-injection procedure by filing a postconviction petition in a Florida trial court, which dismissed his claim as procedurally barred. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed ( 921 So. 2d 579, cert. denied, 546 U.S. ____, 126 S. Ct. 1441, 164 L. Ed. 2d 141). In an action brought in January 2006, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. _ 1983, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, the defendant (1) alleged that the injection procedure that would likely be used on him--the same three-drug procedure that had been at issue in the 2000 Florida Supreme Court decision--(a) caused a foreseeable risk of gratuitous and unnecessary pain, and (b) violated the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments in the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment; and (2) sought an injunction to bar state officials ""from executing [the defendant] in the manner they currently intend."" However, the District Court, in dismissing the complaint, concluded that (1) the _ 1983 claim was the functional equivalent of a federal habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C.S. _ 2254; and (2) for procedural reasons, the  [**45]  petition was barred under 28 U.S.C.S. _ 2244(b). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed ( 437 F.3d 1084)."
"A railroad brakeman, injured when, during the course of his work, he slipped on a large, partially covered cinder embedded in the roadbed, sought recovery from his employer in an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. At the trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, the employer's motion for a directed verdict was denied, and judgment was entered on a jury finding that the employer was negligent in causing or permitting the cinder to be at the place where the brakeman fell."
"Respondent Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) is the administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s (Wal-Mart) Group Long Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Plan's insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant to the judicial review provision in ERISA ¬¨¬®‚àö√º502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after ""proof of loss"" is due. Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford. After petitioner exhausted the mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial. Almost three years after that final denial but more than three years after proof of loss was due, Ieimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pursuant to ERISA ¬¨¬®‚àö√º502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was untimely. The District Court granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent, The Second Circuit affirmed."
"The state of Indiana and several of its officials and the Indiana Coal Association and several coal mine operators brought suits against the Secretary of the Interior in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, alleging that the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 USCS 1201 et seq.) contravened the commerce clause of the United States Constitution (Art I, 8, cl 3), the equal protection and due process guarantees of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, and the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment. The suits included challenges to the ""prime farmland"" provisions of the Act ( 507(b)(16), 508(a)(2)(C), 510(d)(1), 515(b)(7), (20), and 519(c)(2); 30 USCS 1257(b)(16), 1258(a)(2)(C), 1260(d)(1), 1265(b)(7), (20), and 1269(c)(2)), as well as 15 other substantive provisions applying to surface mining generally ( 515(b)(3), (5), 522(a), (c), (d), (e)(4), (5), 508(a)(2), (3), (4), (8), (10), 510(b)(1), (2), and 515(b)(19), (20); 30 USCS 1265(b)(3)(5), 1272(a), (c), (d), (e)(4), (5), 1258(a)(2), (3), (4), (8), (10), 1260(b)(1), (2), and 1265(b)(19), (20). Following a hearing, the District Court issued an order and opinion sustaining each of the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges and permanently enjoined the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing the challenged sections of the Act (501 F Supp 452)."
"An individual asserted an entitlement to Social Security survivors' benefits. The individual acknowledged that for purposes of the 42 USCS 416(h)(2)(A) reference to state intestacy law for deciding whether a claimant was a ""child"" of the deceased, the relevant state law appeared on its face to defeat the individual's claim, by imposing some procedural requirements which the individual could not meet for proof of paternity as a prerequisite for intestate succession. However, the individual alleged that the proof-of-paternity requirements were unconstitutional. The Social Security Administration's Appeals Council denied benefits to the individual. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in upholding the denial, adopted a rationale advanced by the government in its brief to the Court of Appeals, which rationale was to the effect that the constitutionality of a state paternity law need not be considered before applying the law to determine entitlement to benefits."

"A prisoner in a Hawaiian state prison was transferred to a state prison in California on the recommendation of the Hawaiian prison's ""Program Committee"" which, after hearings, singled the prisoner out as a troublemaker and which, after another set of hearings, suggested that he be transferred. The prisoner filed suit under 42 USCS 1983. He alleged that he had been denied procedural due process because the committee that had recommended his transfer consisted of the same persons who had initiated the hearing, and who were allegedly biased against him, in specific violation of a state Corrections Division Rule, which requires a hearing to be conducted by an impartial Program Committee. The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii dismissed the complaint, holding that the state regulations governing prison transfers did not create a substantive liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (459 F Supp 473). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state had created a constitutionally protected liberty interest by promulgating the rule in question and reasoning that the rule gave prisoners a justifiable expectation that they would not be transferred to the mainland absent a hearing, before an impartial committee, concerning the facts alleged in the prehearing notice (664 F2d 708)."
"The defendant Negroes, after request for service and a response, remained, peacefully and without creating a disturbance to its use by others, in a public library for 10 to 15 minutes, and then refused to leave after requested to do so by librarians and a sheriff. They were convicted in a Louisiana state court on charges of having violated a statute making it a criminal offense to congregate in a public building with intent to provoke, or under circumstances that may occasion, a breach of the peace, and to refuse to move on when so ordered by an authorized person. The Supreme Court of Louisiana denied their application for discretionary relief. (246 La 878, 168 So 2d 104.)"
"A sales clerk at an adult bookstore in Maryland was convicted of distributing obscene materials, in violation of state law, following a trial at which allegedly obscene magazines purchased at the store by an undercover police officer shortly before the clerk's warrantless arrest were admitted in evidence. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed the conviction on grounds that the magazines were improperly admitted in evidence (57 Md App 705, 471 A2d 1090). The Maryland Supreme Court denied certiorari (300 Md 795, 481 A2d 240)."
"In his application for naturalization in 1925, petitioner swore that his occupation was ""real estate"" when his only regular and continuing concern was bootlegging, on which he depended for his livelihood. A denaturalization proceeding commenced against him in 1956 was dismissed on the ground that an affidavit of good cause for the proceeding had not been filed. Thereafter, the United States commenced a new denaturalization proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the court revoked the petitioner's citizenship on the ground that the petitioner had procured a certificate of naturalization by wilful misrepresentation and fraud. (171 F Supp 10.) The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. (275 F2d 355.)"
"A church eldership brought suit in the Circuit Court of Washington County, Maryland, seeking (1) to prevent two local churches from withdrawing from the eldership, and (2) to obtain property claimed by the local churches. The complaint was dismissed, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed (249 Md 650, 241 A2d 691). After the United States Supreme Court remanded the case for further consideration (393 US 528, 21 L Ed 2d 750, 89 S Ct 850), the Court of Appeals adhered to the result reached in its earlier decision, basing its determination upon (1) Maryland statutory provisions governing the holding of property by religious corporations, (2) language in the deeds conveying the properties in question to the local churches, (3) the terms of the charters of the local churches, and (4) provisions in the eldership's constitution pertaining to the ownership and control of church property (254 Md 162, 254 A2d 162)."
"In a suit by a licensee for a declaratory judgment declaring a patent invalid, the licensor counterclaimed for unpaid royalties or damages for infringement. The District Court held that the licensee was estopped to challenge the validity of the patent."
"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Attorney General of Rhode Island, and a privately-owned public utility which generated and transmitted electricity at wholesale from several hydroelectric plants within New Hampshire and which was licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to the Federal Power Act (16 USCS 792 et seq.) appealed to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire an order of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission requiring the utility to arrange to sell within New Hampshire hydroelectric energy which it had previously exported to, among other places, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. They claimed that the order was preempted by Parts I and II of the Act (16 USCS 792-824k) and imposed impermissible burdens on interstate commerce. The court rejected those arguments, concluding that the ""savings clause"" of 201(b) of the Act (16 USCS 824(b))--which provides that the Act's provisions delegating exclusive authority to FERC to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce ""shall not ... deprive a State or State Commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line""--granted New Hampshire authority to restrict the interstate transportation of hydroelectric power generated within the state, and holding that the New Hampshire Commission's order did not interfere with FERC's exclusive regulatory authority over rates charged for interstate sales of electricity at wholesale (120 NH 866, 424 A2d 807)."
"The trustee for a company that was undergoing bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut filed suit in a Connecticut state court against a bank that was the successor in interest to one of the company's creditors, which suit sought to hold the bank liable for various torts and breaches of contract. The bank removed the suit to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, which referred the suit to the Bankruptcy Court. The trustee then filed a demand for a jury trial, and the Bankruptcy Court denied the bank's motion to strike the demand (103 BR 388). The District Court affirmed (112 BR 57). The bank filed a petition for leave to appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; but the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, as it ruled that, with respect to cases in which Federal District Courts sit as appellate courts in bankruptcy, 28 USCS 158(d)--which gives the Federal Courts of Appeals jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the District Courts in such cases--precludes by negative implication any interlocutory review under 28 USCS 1292, which gives the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction over certain interlocutory orders of the District Courts (926 F2d 197)."
"A class action for injunctive and declaratory relief and damages was instituted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the constitutionality of Illinois statutes providing for the repossession, retitling, and resale of automobiles upon a purchaser's default under a security agreement, allegedly without notice, hearing, and impartial determination of default prior to repossession. A three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to 28 USCS 2281, dismissed the complaint, holding that the named plaintiff lacked standing to maintain the action, since (1) the repossession and resale of the plaintiff's car by the creditor had already taken place and thus injunction of future enforcement of the statutes was a useless act so far as the plaintiff was concerned, and (2) it was alleged that the plaintiff had not been in default, the complaint thus being directed not at the constitutionality of the statutory scheme but only at the creditor's alleged abuse of the scheme (363 F Supp 143). The named plaintiff appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court under 28 USCS 1253, which authorizes an appeal to the Supreme Court from any order granting or denying injunctive relief in any civil action required to be heard by a three-judge District Court."
"A permanent resident alien who briefly left the United States was detained upon her return, and it was subsequently found in an exclusion hearing held pursuant to 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 USCS 1226(a)) that she smuggled aliens into the United States, that her trip was a meaningful departure from the United States, and that her return was therefore an ""entry"" within the meaning of 101(a)(13) of the Act (8 USCS 1101(a)(13)). Upon these findings, she was ordered to be excluded and deported. After the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed her administrative appeal and denied her motion to reopen the proceeding, the alien filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, which held that there was no meaningful departure on the part of the alien, and that she was therefore entitled to a deportation hearing, the District Court therefore vacating the Board's decision and instructing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to proceed against the alien, if at all, only in deportation proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the alien was entitled to litigate her admissibility in deportation proceedings, since it would be circular and unfair to allow the question of entry to be determined in exclusion hearings when the question also went to the merits of the alien's admissibility (637 F2d 1286)."
"The defendant union, as the representative of the employees of the stewards' department on a large majority of vessels flying the American flag on the Pacific coast, picketed a foreign ship in American waters and threatened to extend its picketing to the consignee of the ship's cargo should an attempt be made to unload that cargo. All members of the ship's crew were aliens working under employment contracts made outside the United States. The action of the union was designed to protest against the loss of livelihood of union seamen to seamen on ships under foreign flag with substandard wages and working conditions."
