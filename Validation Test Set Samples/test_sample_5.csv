"In a suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity under the First Amendment's establishment clause of Chapter 414 of the New York Laws of 1972, a three-judge court (1) enjoined enforcement of 1 of the Act, which provided for direct money grants from the state to ""qualifying"" non- public schools, to be used for the maintenance and repair of school facilities and equipment and (2) enjoined enforcement of 2 of the statute, which provided tuition reimbursements to parents of children attending elementary or secondary nonpublic schools, but (3) refused to enjoin enforcement of 3-5 of the statute, which provided state income tax relief to parents of nonpublic school children, on the ground that only 1 and 2 of the statute violated the establishment clause (350 F Supp 655)."
"Negro employees of a power company brought a class action against their employer in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that the employer violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by requiring a high school diploma and a satisfactory intelligence test score for certain jobs previously limited to white employees, so as to preserve the effects of the employer's past racial discrimination. The District Court dismissed their complaint (292 F Supp 243). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court's holding that residual discrimination arising from past employment practices was insulated from remedial action, but it affirmed the District Court's holding that absent a discriminatory purpose, the diploma and test requirements were proper (420 F2d 1225)."
"Prior to an accused rapist's trial before a Virginia trial court, defense counsel moved for discovery of the alleged victim's statements to police describing her assailants, the vehicle they were driving, and the location where the alleged rape took place. The trial court denied the motion after examining those statements in chambers and determining that they contained no exculpatory evidence. Following the accused's conviction, defense counsel filed a notice of appeal which assigned the denial of the discovery motion as error, but counsel failed to include that claim in the petition for appeal, even though state rules precluded review of alleged errors not assigned in that petition. The Supreme Court of Virginia refused the appeal; and the accused's petition for state habeas corpus relief, based on his claim that the withholding of the victim's statements violated his right to due process of law, was dismissed, and the Supreme Court of Virginia denied certiorari. The accused then petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for federal habeas corpus relief, stating the same claim. The District Court dismissed that petition, holding that because the accused had failed to present his due process claim on direct appeal, he was barred from doing so in federal court under the rule of Wainwright v Sykes (1977) 433 US 72, 53 L Ed 2d 594, 97 L Ed 2d 2497, absent a showing of prejudice and of cause for his procedural default. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (1) reversed the judgment of the District Court, holding that an act or omission by counsel which shows ignorance or oversight may satisfy the ""cause"" requirement of Wainwright v Sykes; and (2) remanded for a determination as to whether the procedural default in this case was the result of such attorney error or reflected a deliberate appellate strategy (724 F2d 396, adhered to 754 F2d 520)."
"North Carolina's Dental Practice Act (Act) provides that the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is ""the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry."" The Board's principal duty is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system for dentists; and six of its eight members must be licensed, practicing dentists. The Act does not specify that teeth whitening is ""the practice of dentistry."" Nonetheless, after dentists complained to the Board that nondentists were charging lower prices for such services than dentists did, the Board issued at least 47 official cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manufacturers, often warning that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime. This and other related Board actions led nondentists to cease offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative complaint, alleging that the Board's concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the Board's motion to dismiss on the ground of state-action immunity. The FTC sustained that ruling, reasoning that even if the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition, the Board must be actively supervised by the State to claim immunity, which it was not. After a hearing on the merits, the ALJ determined that the Board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. The FTC again sustained the ALJ, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects."
"At hearings in which the petitioners had their probation revoked and received deferred sentences, they were neither represented by counsel nor advised of the right to have counsel appointed. In habeas corpus proceedings, the Washington Supreme Court held that under Mempa v Rhay, 389 US 128, 19 L Ed 2d 336, 88 S Ct 254, the petitioners' constitutional right to counsel was denied, but it was held that because the Mempa rule was not retroactively applicable, the petitioners were not entitled to relief."
"While law enforcement officers were investigating the sale of marijuana and making arrests at a residence in Florida, a man who was subsequently accused of various drug offenses drove up to the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked toward the back of his vehicle. An officer met the accused at the rear of the vehicle and asked him his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of the license revealed an outstanding warrant, the officer arrested the accused, handcuffed him, and took him inside the residence. The officer then went back outside and searched the vehicle. The search revealed several small bags containing methamphetamine, and the accused was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial court granted the accused's motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, finding the search valid under New York v Belton (1981) 453 US 454, 69 L Ed 2d 768, 101 S Ct 2860, which established a bright-line rule permitting a law enforcement officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a car to search the passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest (711 So 2d 1241). The Supreme Court of Florida reversed--holding that Belton is limited to situations in which the officer initiates contact with the arrestee while the arrestee remains in the car--and remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the search was justified under Chimel v California (1969) 395 US 752, 23 L Ed 2d 685, 89 S Ct 2034 (761 So 2d 1010). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider whether Belton was so limited."
"Timothy Smith was indicted in the Northern District of Florida for theft of trade secrets from a website owned by StrikeLines. Before trial, Smith moved to dismiss the indictment for lack of venue, citing the Constitution‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s Venue Clause, Art. III, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2, cl. 3, and its Vicinage Clause, Amdt. 6. Smith argued that trial in the Northern District of Florida was improper because he had accessed StrikeLines‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• website from his home in Mobile (in the Southern District of Alabama) and the servers storing StrikeLines‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• data were located in Orlando (in the Middle District of Florida). The District Court concluded that factual disputes related to venue should be resolved by the jury and denied Smith‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The jury found Smith guilty, and Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal based on improper venue. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that the effects of Smith‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s crime were felt at StrikeLines‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• headquarters, located in the Northern District of Florida. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit determined that venue was improper, but disagreed with Smith that a trial in an improper venue barred reprosecution. The Eleventh Circuit therefore vacated Smith‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s conviction for theft of trade secrets."
"The present plaintiff, a mortgagor who obtained mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration, instituted the present suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina for a declaration of its right to rent some of the apartments in the mortgaged apartment building to transients. The District Court gave plaintiff substantially the relief which it demanded. (142 F Supp 341.) On appeal, the United States Supreme Court remanded the cause for consideration by a three-judge court. (352 US 977, 1 L ed 2d 363, 77 S Ct 381.) On remand, a three-judge court held that rentals to transients were not barred by 608 of the National Housing Act, as amended by 10 of the Veterans' Emergency Housing Act of 1946 (12 USC 1743), and that 513 (a) of the National Housing Act, as added by the Housing Act of 1954 (12 USC 1731b), which specifically prohibited such rentals, was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff, which had obtained the insurance prior to the effective date of the 1954 act. (154 F Supp 411.)"
"A claimant applied for Social Security disability benefits because a back condition and hypertension prevented her from continuing her work as a hotel maid. After her application was denied, the claimant requested a hearing de novo before an administrative law judge. Relying on medical-vocational guidelines promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the administrative law judge found that a significant number of jobs existed that a person of the claimant's qualifications could perform and therefore concluded that the claimant was not disabled. This determination was upheld by both the Social Security Appeals Council and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the Secretary was required to introduce evidence that specific alternative jobs existed (665 F2d 48)."
"It was provided in 18 USCS 924(c)(1) (later amended) that (1) anyone who used or carried a ""firearm"" during or in relation to a crime of violence would, in addition to the sentence for that crime, be sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment; and (2) if the firearm was of certain particular types, including a ""machinegun,"" the additional sentence would be 30 years. Some individuals who had engaged in a violent confrontation with federal officers were tried in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas on charges of conspiring to murder those officers. The jury determined that the individuals had violated 924(c)(1) by using firearms in connection with the alleged conspiracy. The District Court then imposed the mandatory 30-year sentence, partly on the basis of the District Court's determination that the individuals had actually or constructively possessed machineguns and hand grenades. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (1) remanded for a determination whether the individuals had used, rather than merely possessed, machineguns and other enhanced weapons; (2) determined that statutory terms such as ""machinegun"" did not state elements of a crime separate from that of using a firearm, but instead established factors enhancing a sentence; and (3) concluded that (a) no jury determination as to the use of machineguns was required, and (b) the District Court could reimpose the 30-year sentence if the District Court found that enhanced weapons had been actively used (91 F3d 699). The District Court reimposed the 30-year sentence, and the Court of Appeals affirmed (179 F3d 321)."
"An irrevocable trust instrument, executed in 1924 in New York, provided that the income from the trust should be paid to the settlor during life, that on his death the trust should be terminated and the corpus distributed to his issue then surviving; and that in the event he should have no lawful issue surviving, the corpus should be paid in equal shares to his brothers and sisters then surviving, any child or children of a deceased brother or sister to take the share which the parent would have been entitled to receive if living. However, the trust agreement made no provision for disposal of the trust assets if the settlor died without children and without any of his brothers or sisters, or their children, surviving him. The Revenue Act then in force, as well as prior and all the subsequent revenue acts, required for estate tax purposes the inclusion in a decedent's gross estate of the value of all the property the decedent in his lifetime had transferred by trust, to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. In 1930, in May v. Heiner, 281 US 238, 74 L ed 826, 50 S Ct 286, 67 ALR 1244, the United States Supreme Court, overruling earlier cases to the contrary, held that the corpus of a trust transfer need not be included in a settlor's estate, even though the settlor had retained for himself a life income from the corpus. In 1931, upon request of the Treasury, the doctrine of May v. Heiner, supra, was repudiated by a Joint Resolution of Congress, which, however, did not purport, and was construed by the Supreme Court not to be intended, to operate retroactively."
"The United States--later replaced as plaintiff by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)--brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.), to enjoin a union and its apprenticeship committee from engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination against black and Hispanic individuals. The District Court (1) found that the defendants had violated Title VII by discriminating against nonwhite workers in recruitment, selection, training, and admission to the union, (2) enjoined the defendants from discriminating against nonwhites, (3) enjoined specific practices found to be discriminatory, and (4) prompted by continuing attempts by the defendants to prevent or delay affirmative action, set a 29% nonwhite membership goal based on the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant labor pool in New York City for the union to achieve by a specified date (401 F Supp 467); the District Court later approved an affirmative action program proposed by a court-appointed administrator (421 F Supp 603). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's determination of liability, the membership goal, and the appointment of the administrator (532 F2d 821). On remand, the District Court adopted a revised affirmative action program and extended the time for compliance with the membership goal, and the Court of Appeals again affirmed (565 F2d 31). The District Court later twice found the defendants guilty of civil contempt for disobeying the court's orders and ordered them to pay a fine to be placed in a fund designed to increase nonwhite membership in the union, and in the second contempt proceeding, the court also raised the membership goal to 29.23% and set a new time limit for achieving it. The Court of Appeals (1) affirmed the District Court's contempt findings (with one exception) and contempt remedies, including the fund order and the affirmative action program, (2) found the new membership goal to be proper in light of the union's long-continued and egregious racial discrimination, and (3) concluded that the membership goal violated neither Title VII nor the Federal Constitution (753 F2d 1172)."
"The plaintiffs in the present tax refund cases entered into contracts with the owners of coal-bearing lands, terminable without cause on short notice, to provide the equipment and do the work required to strip mine and deliver to the owners coal from the land, as independent contractors, for a fixed unit price. The issue was whether the plaintiffs, under the circumstances stated above, were entitled under 23(m) and 114(b)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to an allowance for depletion on amounts received by them under the contracts. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. ( No. 218, 255 F2d 595; No. 305, 255 F2d 599.)"
"Watchmaker Omega S.A. sued Costco Wholesale Corp. when it bought a shipment of the Swiss-made watches from another importer and sold them for below Omega's suggested retail price. Omega contends that Costco's sale infringes on their copyright of the Omega logo on the back face of the watch. Meanwhile, Costco argues that Omega is precluded from bringing a copyright action after a sale due to the Doctrine of Exhaustion, or ""first sale"" rule, under which certain rights are ""exhausted"" after a sale of the copyrighted good. A judge on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California backed Costco, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the first-sale doctrine did not apply to imported goods manufactured abroad."
"After protracted litigation in the Interstate Commerce Commission and the federal courts, which, insofar as relevant, involved the increase of railroad rates for recyclable materials, a group of law students and other environmental groups filed, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the instant lawsuit against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission as defendants, wherein the nation's railroads intervened as defendants. The plaintiffs claimed that the Commission's decision not to suspend a surcharge pending its investigation was made without preparing an environmental impact statement or considering environmental issues, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 USCS 4321 et seq.); that the pre-existing rate structure discriminated against recyclables; and that the across-the-board rate surcharge had unfortunate consequences to the environment in that use of recyclable materials would be inhibited and use of virgin materials encouraged; the complaint sought to compel the Commission to suspend the rate surcharge and to enjoin the railroad from collecting it. A three-judge District Court set aside the Commission's order terminating a general revenue proceeding without declaring unlawful the rate increases as to the recyclables; the Court directed the Commission to reopen the proceeding, prepare a better environmental impact statement, hold hearings and reconsider, in the light of the new statement, its determination not to declare unlawful the rate increases applicable to recyclables (371 F Supp 1291)."
"With respect to the jurisdiction of a Federal Court of Appeals over appeals from a Federal District Court's decisions, the United States Supreme Court has developed a collateral order doctrine, to the effect that 28 USCS 1291 permits appeals not only from a final decision by which a District Court disassociates itself from a case, but also from a small category of decisions which, although they do not end the litigation, must nonetheless be considered ""final."" Some alleged victims of police raids on a nightclub in an Alabama county (1) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against defendants including the county commission, a sheriff, and some other law enforcement officials; and (2) sought damages and other relief, pursuant to 42 USCS 1983, for alleged civil rights violations. The District Court denied motions for summary judgment by defendants including (1) the individual officials, who argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity from liability; and (2) the commission, which argued that the sheriff, who had authorized the raids, was not a policymaker for the county. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (1) affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court's order denying summary judgment for the individual defendants; (2) ruled that while the District Court's denial of the commission's summary judgment motion was not immediately appealable as a collateral order, judicial economy warranted the exercise of ""pendent appellate jurisdiction"" over the appeal from the denial; and (3) on the merits, reversed the denial of the commission's motion, on the ground that the sheriff was a state executive officer and not an agent of the commission (5 F3d 1435). The Court of Appeals then (1) modified its opinion with respect to some matters concerning the individual defendants' qualified immunity, and (2) denied rehearing en banc (11 F3d 1030)."
"""Gray-market"" goods are foreign-manufactured goods that bear a valid United States trademark, but are imported without the consent of the United States trademark owner. Section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USCS 1526) prohibits the importation of ""any merchandise of foreign manufacture"" without the consent of the trademark owner if such merchandise bears a trademark ""owned"" by a United States citizen, or a corporation or association created or organized within the United States, and the trademark is registered by a person domiciled in the United States. However, a United States Customs Service regulation, promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury ( 19 CFR 133.21), permits the importation of certain gray-market goods where (1) both the foreign and United States trademarks are owned by the same person or business entity ( 19 CFR 133.21(c)(1)), or (2) the foreign and domestic trademark owners are parent and subsidiary companies or are otherwise subject to common ownership or control ( 19 CFR 133.21(c)(2)), or (3) the trademark is applied by an independent foreign manufacturer under authorization of the United States owner ( 19 CFR 133.21(c)(3)). An association of United States trademark owners, and two of its members, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of Customs, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Customs Service regulation, on the ground that the exceptions it provided were inconsistent with 19 USCS 1526. Two corporations intervened as defendants, one of which moved to dismiss on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case. The District Court, holding that it had jurisdiction, denied the motion to dismiss and upheld the Customs Service regulation (598 F Supp 844). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, affirming the jurisdictional ruling but reversing on the merits, held that the regulation was contrary to Congress' clear intent in 19 USCS 1526 (790 F2d 903). On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed with respect to jurisdiction and restored the action to the calendar for reargument on the merits (485 US 176, 99 L Ed 2d 151, 108 S Ct 950). third party imports and distributes the foreign-made goods.)"
"Guam and the United States dispute liability for environmental hazards at the Ordot Dump, a site constructed on the island by the Navy in the 1940s and into which both parties allegedly have deposited waste over the decades. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Guam entered into a consent decree in 2004 that resolved litigation filed by the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act. The decree in relevant part required Guam to pay a civil penalty and to take certain actions at the dump, and also stated that Guam‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s compliance would constitute full settlement and satisfaction of the civil claims of the United States as alleged in the EPA‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s complaint (i.e., claims under the Clean Water Act). More than a decade later, Guam sued the United States under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), alleging that the United States‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• use of the dump exposed it to two possible actions under the Act. The first was a ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´cost-recovery‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ action under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º107(a), which allows recovery of the costs of a ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´removal or remedial action‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ from ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ The second was a ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´contribution‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ action under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º113(f), which provides that a party that ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´has resolved its liability to the United States‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨‚àÇfor some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in [a] settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not [already] party to a [qualifying] settlement.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º113(f)(3)(B). The D. C. Circuit rejected Guam‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s CERCLA claims against the United States. The court determined that although Guam had once possessed a CERCLA contribution claim based on the 2004 consent decree that sufficiently ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´resolved Guam‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s liability‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ for the dump, that claim was time barred. The court further held that a party eligible to pursue a contribution claim under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º113(f) cannot assert a cost-recovery claim under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º107(a), leaving Guam no CERCLA remedy. As relevant here, Guam now contends that the 2004 consent decree did not give rise to a viable CERCLA contribution claim, leaving Guam free to pursue a cost-recovery action. The case turns on whether CERCLA authorizes a contribution claim only when a party resolves a CERCLA-specific liability or whether settlement of environmental liabilities under other laws will do."
"In a Federal District Court, a union and its president were adjudged guilty of criminal and civil contempt and fined for violation of a temporary restraining order issued in a suit by the Government in a labor dispute arising while the coal mines were in the possession of, and were being operated by, the Government pursuant to Executive Order 9728, 11 F. R. 5593, issued under the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy and authority conferred upon him by the War Labor Disputes Act, 57 Stat. 163. 70 F.Supp. 42. While an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was pending, this Court granted certiorari pursuant to _ 240 (a) of the Judicial Code. 329 U.S. 708, 709, 710."
"The Comptroller of Currency ordered certificates issued to two national banks in Utah, permitting them to open branches without taking over existing banks. In No. 51, the United States District Court for the District of Utah held that the certificate before it was properly issued, even though 12 USC 36(c), authorizes national banks to establish new branches within the limits of the municipality in which the bank is located if such operation is authorized to state banks by state law, and Utah law prohibited Utah banks from establishing branches except by taking over an existing bank which had been in operation for not less than 5 years. (234 F Supp 74.) The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. (352 F2d 90.) In Nos. 73 and 88, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia enjoined the Comptroller of Currency from authorizing the establishment of the other branch bank (236 F Supp 457), and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed."
"An inmate in a local jail, who had supposedly slipped on a pillow negligently left on a stairway by a corrections officer, filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, for alleged violations of his constitutional rights, claiming that the officer had negligently deprived him of his liberty interest in freedom from bodily injury, and that this deprivation was without due process of law because the officer claimed that he would be entitled to a defense of sovereign immunity in a state tort action. The District Court granted the officer's motion for summary judgment. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, finding that the inmate would not be deprived of a meaningful opportunity to present his case in state court even if the officer could make out a defense of sovereign immunity (720 F2d 792). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that the negligent infliction of bodily injury does not constitute a deprivation of any interest protected by the due process clause, and that the inmate had an adequate remedy in state court, since the ministerial nature of the officer's duties would have precluded him from successfutly defending on the ground of sovereign immunity (748 F2d 229)."
"The inmate claimed that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial regarding his borderline mental retardation. A state postconviction court found that the inmate's attorneys made a strategic decision to omit the evidence. Although the Supreme Court granted certiorari as to a question regarding the relationship between ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1), resolution of that issue was unnecessary because the state court's factual finding was not unreasonable under ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 2254(d)(2). The inmate argued that the attorney who handled the penalty phase was inexperienced and never made a strategic decision not to offer evidence regarding the inmate's alleged mental deficiencies. However, the evidence showed that all three of the inmate's attorneys read a mental evaluation of the inmate. The inmate also claimed that he was entitled to relief under ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 2254(d)(1) based on an unreasonable application of law because his attorneys failed to sufficiently investigate his mental condition, but that argument was not fairly included in the questions before the Court and could not be reviewed pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a)."
"In Rehaif v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, the Court clarified the mens rea requirement for firearms-possession offenses under 18 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g). After Rehaif, the Government in a felon-in-possession case must prove not only that the defendant knew he possessed a firearm, but also that he knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearm. See 588 U. S., at ___. Prior to Rehaif, Gregory Greer and Michael Gary were separately convicted of being felons in possession of a firearm in violation of ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g)(1). Greer‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s conviction resulted from a jury trial during which Greer did not request‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üand the District Court did not give‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üa jury instruction requiring the jury to find that Greer knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearm. Gary pled guilty to two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. During Gary‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s plea colloquy, the District Court did not advise Gary that, if he went to trial, a jury would have to find that he knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearms. On appeal, both Greer and Gary raised new mens rea arguments based on Rehaif. Greer requested a new trial based on the District Court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s failure to instruct the jury that Greer had to know he was a felon to be found guilty. Applying plain-error review, the Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument. Gary argued that his guilty plea must be vacated because the District Court failed to advise him that, if he went to trial, a jury would have to find that he knew he was a felon. The Fourth Circuit agreed with Gary, holding that the failure to advise him of that mens rea element was a structural error that required automatic reversal even though Gary had not raised the argument in the District Court."
"The defendant, after conviction for second degree murder upon trial in an Oregon court, filed a petition for postconviction relief, and the trial court found that the defendant's rights had been materially affected by the conduct of the bailiff, assigned to shepherd the sequestered jury, in stating to some of the jurors that the defendant was guilty and that if there was anything wrong in finding the defendant guilty the Supreme Court would correct it. The Supreme Court of Oregon reversed, finding that the bailiff's misconduct had not deprived the defendant of a constitutionally fair trial. (407 P2d 246.)"
"Two laborers who worked for a railroad at its Virginia terminal, where coal was loaded from railway cars to ships on navigable waters, were injured while they were engaged in cleaning spilled coal from the loading equipment, which task was one of their employment duties. In an unrelated incident at another Virginia coal loading terminal, a pier machinist who was employed by another railroad was injured while engaged in his primary job of repairing that railroad's coal loading equipment. The three employees commenced separate actions in Virginia trial courts against the railroads, seeking damages for their personal injuries under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCS 51-60). In each case, the railroad challenged the trial court's jurisdiction on the ground that the employee's exclusive remedy was provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 USCS 901-950; later renamed). The trial courts concluded that the employees in each case were covered by the LHWCA, and dismissed the employees' suits. All three employees appealed. Reviewing the judgments against the two laborers on consolidated appeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, holding that the laborers were not covered by the LHWCA since they had been performing purely maintenance tasks, and thus that they should be treated no differently under the LHWCA than those who were excluded because they performed purely clerical tasks (235 Va 27, 365 SE2d 742). Subsequently, in an unpublished order, the Virginia Supreme Court also reversed the trial court's judgment in the pier machinist's case, relying on its decision in the laborers' case."
"Under 18 USCS 922(d)(4), it is unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell firearms to a person who has been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. Other federal firearms disabilities related to mental capacity or institutional commitment are contained in 18 USCS 922(g), 922(h), and 18 USCS Appx 1202(a)(1), 1202(a)(3). In 1982, after a customer, who had been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for several days in 1971, answered affirmatively as to whether he had been committed to a mental hospital, a store in New Jersey refused to sell a firearm to the customer, in accordance with 922(d)(4). Under 18 USCS 925(c) (later amended) as it then read, certain former felons could apply to the United States Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for administrative relief, but no such relief was then available to former mental patients. When the Bureau therefore rejected the customer's request for a special exemption from federal firearms disabilities, the customer filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, challenging the constitutionality of the federal firearms legislation. The District Court concluded that those portions of the federal firearms statutes which deprived the customer of his ability to purchase a firearm were unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, for (1) the statutory scheme violated equal protection principles due to the lack of a rational basis for singling out mental patients for permanent firearms-disability status, particularly as compared to convicts; and (2) the statutory scheme unconstitutionally created an irrebuttable presumption that one who had been committed, no matter what the circumstances, was forever mentally ill and dangerous (602 F Supp 682). After the United States Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction of the Federal Government's appeal of the decision, and the case had been argued, Congress passed a statute (Firearm Owners' Protection Act, PL 99-308, 100 Stat 449) which (1) amended 18 USCS 925(c) to permit administrative relief by the Secretary of the Treasury from firearms disabilities to any person who was prohibited under the federal statutes from possessing, shipping, transporting, or receiving firearms or ammunition (100 Stat 449, 105); and (2) made this amendment applicable to any pending action, petition, or appellate proceeding (100 Stat 449, 110)."
"The instant cases, Nos. 81 and 82, involve the question whether the constitutional principles announced by the United States Supreme Court in Chimel v California (1969) 395 US 752, 23 L Ed 2d 685, 89 S Ct 2034, should be applied retroactively. In the Chimel Case, decided on June 23, 1969, the Supreme Court (1) overruling Harris v United States (1947) 331 US 145, 91 L Ed 1399, 67 S Ct 1089, and United States v Rabinowitz (1950) 339 US 56, 94 L Ed 653, 70 S Ct 430, announced constitutional standards which had the effect of narrowing the permissible scope of a search incident to an arrest, and (2) without discussing the issue of retroactivity, reversed Chimel's conviction, thereby retroactively applying the new standards to a search which had been conducted in Chimel's house."
"The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals of New York for further consideration in light of In re Winship, ante, p. 358. Juvenile Case"
"A news correspondent and an association of journalists requested, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 USCS 552), that the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) disclose any criminal records in its possession concerning four brothers whose family company allegedly had obtained defense contracts as a result of an improper arrangement with a corrupt Congressman. The Department denied the request with respect to the three brothers who were still living, but released the ""rap sheet,"" or criminal identification record, of the fourth, deceased brother. The correspondent and the association, seeking to compel fuller disclosure but limiting their request to documents containing information that was a matter of public record, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. While the suit was pending, two more of the brothers died, and the FBI (1) released the requested data concerning those brothers, (2) indicated that any financial crime information about the remaining brother could be disclosed in the public interest, but that no such information existed, and (3) refused to release any rap sheet or other records containing nonfinancial criminal information about the remaining brother. The District Court, granting the Department's motion for summary judgment after an in camera review of the requested information, held that such information was exempted from FOIA's disclosure requirements by various FOIA provisions, including Exemption 7(C) (5 USCS 552(b)(7)(C)), which applies to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes where production of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded (259 App DC 426, 816 F2d 730), holding that (1) Exemption 7(C) was inapplicable, because, in the absence of any statutory standards by which to judge the public interest in disclosure, a court should be bound by state and local determinations that such information should be made available to the general public, and (2) no other FOIA exemptions were applicable. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to determine, on remand, whether the withheld information was publicly available at its source, and if so, whether the Department might satisfy its statutory obligation by referring the journalists to the enforcement agency or agencies that had provided the original information. On rehearing, the Court of Appeals, modifying its holding, said that most state policies in fact did not favor disclosure of rap sheets, but that the District Court should nonetheless make a factual determination whether the remaining brother's privacy interest in his rap-sheet information had faded because such information appeared on the public record (265 App DC 365, 831 F2d 1124). The Court of Appeals subsequently denied rehearing en banc."
"Three American corporations engaged in the business of providing overseas record telecommunications services filed a rulemaking petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that the FCC disclaim any intent to negotiate with foreign governments in what is known as the Consultative Process at which members of the FCC's Telecommunications Committee participate with their European and Canadian counterparts to facilitate joint planning of telecommunications facilities through an exchange of information on regulatory policies, and at which the FCC hopes to persuade the European nations to co-operate with the FCC's policy of encouraging competition in the provision of telecommunications services. The corporations contended that such negotiations were ultra vires the agency's authority, and that the federal Sunshine Act (5 USCS 552b) required that the Consultative Process sessions, as ""meetings"" of the FCC, be held in public. The FCC denied the rulemaking petition, and while an appeal from this denial was pending in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the corporations filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia raising the same issues and seeking injunctive relief. The District Court dismissed the ultra vires count on jurisdictional grounds, but ordered the FCC to comply with the Sunshine Act. On consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that the Sunshine Act applied to meetings of the Consultative Process, but reversed the District Court's dismissal of the ultra vires count (699 F2d 1219)."
