summary
"An individual was convicted of murder in the Superior Court, Criminal Division, Lake County, Indiana, and the Supreme Court of Indiana affirmed (266 Ind 126, 360 NE2d 1257). The defendant then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court, but it was dismissed. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the defendant claimed that since his attorney had represented a prosecution witness in an unrelated case, the defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals agreed, reversing the District Court's dismissal on the grounds that the defendant's attorney's representation of the prosecution witness constituted a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective representation and that while the ineffective assistance argument had never been presented to the state court, in view of the clear violation of the defendant's rights and in the interest of judicial economy, there was no reason to await the state court's consideration of the issue."
"The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides that prisoners qualified to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) must nonetheless pay an imitial partial filing fee, set as ""20 percent of the greater of"" the average monthly deposits in the prisoner's account or the average monthly balance of the account over the preceding six months. 28 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1915(b)(1). They must then pay the remainder of the fee in monthly installments of ""20 percent of the preceding month's income credited to the prisoner's account."" ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1915(b)(2). The initial partial fee is assessed on a per-case basis, i.e., each time the prisoner ifies a lawsuit. The initial payment may not be exacted if the prisoner has no means to pay it, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1915(b)(4), and no monthly installments are required unless the prisoner has more than $10 in his account, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1915(b)(2). In contest here is the calculation of subsequent monthly installment payments when more than one fee is owed. Petitioner Antoine Bruce, a federal inmate and a frequent litigant, argued that the monthly filing-fee payments do not become due until filing-fee obligations previously incurred in other cases are satisfied. The D. C. Circuit disagreed, holding that Bruce's monthly payments were due simultaneously with monthly payments in the earlier cases."
"Under 5 (2) (f) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USC 5 (2) (f)), which in its first sentence provides that, as a condition of its approval of a consolidation of railroad facilities, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the railroad employees affected, and in its second sentence provides that in its order of approval the Commission shall include terms and conditions providing that during the period of four years from the effective date of such order such action will not result in employees being in a worse position with respect to their employment, the Interstate Commerce Commission has the power to extend the period of protection of the interests of such employees beyond four years from the effective date of the order, since the time limit fixed in the second sentence does not apply to the powers conferred upon the Commission by the first, and the provision of the second sentence prescribes only the minimum, but not the maximum, period of protection for employees."
"Subheading 9802.00.80 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 USCS 1202) provided importers a partial exemption from duties otherwise imposed for articles which (1) were assembled abroad, but (2) were not advanced in value or improved in condition abroad, except by operations incidental to the assembly process. A regulation issued by the United States Customs Service provided that (1) chemical treatment of components or assembled articles to impart new characteristics were operations not considered incidental to the assembly, and (2) among examples of such operations was ""permapressing"" ( 19 CFR 10.16(c)(4)). An importer had customs duties imposed upon garments which it shipped to the United States from an assembly plant it controlled in Mexico. While in Mexico, the garments were subjected to one of several different methods of permapressing to maintain creases and avoid wrinkles. The Customs Service denied a duty exemption under 10.16(c)(4). The importer brought suit for refund in the Court of International Trade, which did not treat the regulation as controlling and ruled in the importer's favor. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (1) declined to analyze the regulation, under the rule of Chevron U. S. A. v Natural Resources Defense Council (1984) 467 US 837, 81 L Ed 2d 694, 104 S Ct 2778, to determine whether the regulation was required to be given judicial deference, and (2) affirmed (127 F3d 1460)."
"Several bands of Chippewa Indians, including the Mille Lacs Band, entered into an 1837 treaty (7 Stat 536) in which (1) the bands ceded land in present-day Minnesota to the United States, and (2) the United States guaranteed the bands the usufructuary rights to hunt, fish, and gather on the ceded land ""during the pleasure of the President of the United States."" An 1850 executive order ordered the removal of Chippewa Indians from the ceded land in question and revoked the usufructuary rights that had been granted under the 1837 treaty, and an 1855 treaty (10 Stat 1165) stated that some Chippewa bands relinquished to the United States ""any and all right, title and interest, of whatsoever nature"" in the land. Moreover, in 1858, Congress enacted the enabling act under which Minnesota was admitted as a state of the United States. In an action brought in 1990 against the state of Minnesota by the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the band retained its usufructuary rights under the 1837 treaty and an injunction to prevent the state's interference with those rights, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota concluded that the Mille Lacs Band retained its usufructuary rights under the 1837 treaty (861 F Supp 784). After the District Court permitted several additional Chippewa bands to intervene as plaintiffs in the Mille Lacs litigation and--in a case in which the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians sought a declaration that it retained its rights to hunt, fish, and gather under the 1837 treaty and an 1854 treaty--held that the Fond du Lacs Band retained its usufructuary rights, the District Court consolidated the portions of the two cases that concerned the 1837 treaty, and the District Court issue a final order resolving several resource allocation and regulation issues (952 F Supp 1362). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, affirming the District Court judgments, expressed the view that (1) the 1850 executive order did not abrogate the bands' usufructuary rights, (2) the 1855 treaty did not extinguish the Mille Lacs Band's usufructuary privileges, and (3) Minnesota's admission as a state of the United States did not extinguish any 1837 treaty rights (124 F3d 904)."
"The State of New York submitted its 1972 reapportionment plan for certain counties to the United States Attorney General under 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973c), but the Attorney General concluded that as to certain state legislature districts in Kings County, the state had failed to demonstrate under 5 that the redistricting had neither the purpose nor the effect of abridging the right to vote by reason of race or color. Thereafter, the state submitted a revised plan which did not change the number of districts with nonwhite majorities, but which changed the size of nonwhite majorities in most of such districts. Under the revised plan, a community of Hasidic Jews that had been previously located in a single assembly district with a 61% nonwhite majority and a single senate district with only 37% nonwhites, was divided between different election districts having 65% nonwhite majorities--the state having concluded that a 65% nonwhite majority was necessary to obtain the Attorney General's approval as to such districts. Shortly after the revised redistricting plan had been submitted to the Attorney General, an action on behalf of the Hasidic Jewish community was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs alleging that the state's use of racial criteria and quotas in developing the revised reapportionment plan violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights of the members of the Jewish community. The District Court dismissed the complaint (377 F Supp 1164), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (510 F2d 512)."
"Two Negro candidates for the school board in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Louisiana to enjoin the Louisiana secretary of state from effectuating a state statute requiring that in all primary, general, or special elections, the nomination papers and ballots designate the race of candidates for elective office. A three-judge Federal District Court denied injunctive relief on the ground that the statute was constitutional. (206 F Supp 700.)"
"Separate federal grand jury indictments were returned against the defendant, charging that (1) the defendant, assuming leadership, and nine codefendants had conspired, in violation of 21 USCS 846, to distribute heroin and cocaine during a specified period, and (2) the defendant alone, in violation of 21 USCS 848, had conducted a ""continuing criminal enterprise"" in concert with five or more other persons with respect to whom the defendant occupied a position of organizer, supervisor, and manager, during the same specified period, to distribute and possess heroin and cocaine, and that as the result of such activity, the defendant had obtained a substantial income. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana denied the government's motion to try both indictments at the same trial, the defendant (and his codefendants in the conspiracy case) having objected on the ground that neither the parties nor the charges were the same. The defendant was first convicted of the conspiracy charge, receiving the maximum punishment of 15 years in prison and a fine of $ 25,000, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the conviction. Thereafter, the defendant was convicted of the criminal enterprise charge, receiving the maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of $ 100,000. The District Court rejected the defendant's contention that the conspiracy charged under 846 was a lesser included offense of the criminal enterprise charged under 848, and that thus prosecution for the latter offense was barred under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the criminal enterprise conviction (532 F2d 1101)."
"A longshoreman who suffered injuries while working aboard a vessel in Louisiana navigable waters, recovered damages for his disability, pain and suffering, and loss of earnings in an action against the vessel owner based on unseaworthiness. The longshoreman died shortly thereafter, and his widow then brought the instant wrongful death action, based on unseaworthiness, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The District Court dismissed the widow's suit on grounds of res judicata and failure to state a claim, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed (463 F2d 1331)."
"The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in proceedings to enforce a cease and desist order of the National Labor Relations Board, deleted sua sponte certain clauses of the order. (281 F2d 797.) Certiorari granted; judgment reversed and case remanded to the Court of Appeals to enter judgment affirming and enforcing a cease-and-desist order of the National Labor Relations Board as consented to by respondent - without deletion of references to other labor organizations."
"The issue was whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification could be supplemented by contract. Case law rejected the landlord's argument that general review was allowed for an arbitrator's legal errors. While the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.S. _ 1 et seq., allowed parties to tailor many features of arbitration by contract, the Act's textual features did not provide for enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration. Under the ejusdem generis rule, 9 U.S.C.S. _ 9, which had no textual hook for expanding judicial review, did not authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just any legal error. Rather, 9 U.S.C.S. __ 10 and 11 provided exclusive regimes for the review provided by the FAA. Although the lower court properly held that the FAA confined its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed in 9 U.S.C.S. __ 10 and 11, a remand was appropriate to consider further argument as to whether the arbitration agreement should have been treated as an exercise of the district court's authority to manage its cases under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16."
"Each of the accused, conscientious objectors, was ordered by his draft board to report for civilian work to a hospital located in a district other than the one in which he resided and the order was issued. Without leaving the district of his residence, each accused refused to comply with the order, in violation of 6(j) and 12(a) of the Selective Service Act of 1948, as amended. The question before the Supreme Court concerned the proper venue of the offense."
"At a former stage of the present litigation the Supreme Court of Washington, dismissing a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiffs, professors at a state university, upheld the validity of a statute requiring every public employee to take an oath of nonmembership in subversive organizations and providing that the refusal to do so shall be cause for immediate dismissal. (53 Wash 2d 460, 335 P2d 10.)"
"The Court of Claims has no jurisdiction to enter judgment on a motor carrier's action for compensation for a temporary taking of its properties by the United States, where, during the pendency of the action and prior to the judgment, the carrier filed its claim with the Motor Carrier Claims Commission under the Motor Carrier Claims Commission Act (62 Stat 1222), which provides that the jurisdiction of the Commission over claims presented to it shall be exclusive and permits the pursuit of other available remedies only to a person who does not elect to present his claim to the Commission."
"Article I, 2 of the Federal Constitution requires that seats in the United States House of Representatives be apportioned among the several states ""according to their respective Numbers""--that is, according to the population of each state. After trying various methods of allocating seats, Congress in 1941 enacted a statute (codified at 2 USCS 2a) which provided that after each decennial census the ""method of equal proportions"" would be used to determine the number of Representatives to which each state was entitled. Under the 1990 census, application of the method of equal proportions required, among other results, that the state of Montana, which previously had two seats in the House, would form a single congressional district, while the state of Washington, which previously had eight seats, would gain a ninth. Various plaintiffs including Montana officials filed suit against federal defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, which suit (1) included assertions that apportionment according to the method of equal proportions under 2a violated Article I, 2 because the method did not achieve the greatest possible equality in the number of individuals per representative, and (2) offered evidence that apportionment by the alternative ""method of the harmonic mean""--under which Montana would have two seats and Washington eight, while other states would have the same number of seats as under the method of equal proportions--would result in lower absolute differences from ideal district size. A three-judge District Court granted Montana's motion for summary judgment as to the above claim, as the court ruled that (1) the principle of equal representation for equal numbers of people, previously applied by the United States Supreme Court to the apportionment of congressional seats within states, should also be applied to the apportionment of seats among the states; (2) under that standard, the only population variances among congressional districts that were acceptable were those that were unavoidable despite a good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality, or for which justification was shown; (3) the population variance between Montana's single district and the ideal district could not be justified under that standard; and (4) Congress' decision to adopt the method of equal proportions in 1941 was not entitled to deference, because (a) the decision was made without the benefit of the Supreme Court's subsequent jurisprudence adopting the ""one-person, one-vote"" rule, and (b) the method had been followed automatically in subsequent reapportionments without reconsideration in the light of changing circumstances (775 F Supp 1358)."
"A supplier of a lessee-operator of a truck stop indebted to the supplier sued on the debt in state court. Ancillary to that action and pursuant to state law, the supplier sought prejudgment attachment of certain of the operator's property. The prejudgment attachment procedure required only that the creditor allege, in an ex parte petition, a belief that the debtor was disposing of or might dispose of his property in order to defeat his creditors. Acting upon the petition, a clerk of the state court issued a writ of attachment, which was then executed by the county sheriff which effectively sequestered the debtor's property, although it was left in his possession. Pursuant to the statute, a hearing on the propriety of the attachment and levy was later conducted. Thirty-four days after the levy, a state trial judge ordered the attachment dismissed because the creditor had failed to establish the statutory grounds for attachment alleged in the petition. The debtor subsequently brought an action under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the creditor, alleging that in attaching his property the creditor had acted jointly with the state to deprive him of his property without due process of law. The District Court, construing the complaint as alleging a due process violation both from a misuse of the state procedure and from the statutory procedure itself, held that the alleged actions of the creditor did not constitute state action as required by the Fourteenth Amendment and that the complaint therefore did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted under 1983. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that a private party acts under color of state law within the meaning of 1983 only when there is a usurpation or corruption of official power by the private litigant or surrender of judicial power to the private litigant in such a way that the independence of the enforcing officer has been compromised to a significant degree (639 F2d 1058)."
"A state prisoner whose conviction in a Maine court had been affirmed on appeal, and whose subsequent parole had been revoked, instituted an action in the Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine, originally seeking to challenge the validity of his conviction, but subsequently electing to challenge only the procedure employed for revoking his parole, notwithstanding that the state court judge had warned that he considered the proceedings to be for postconviction relief, governed by a state statute under which grounds for such relief that are not asserted are deemed to be waived. The prisoner's attack on the parole revocation procedures was rejected by the Superior Court, and the decision was sustained on appeal by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine (232 A2d 809). Thereafter, the Superior Court dismissed a subsequent petition for postconviction relief in which the prisoner sought to challenge the validity of his conviction on constitutional grounds, and on appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that the prisoner's failure to assert such claims in the earlier state proceedings constituted a waiver thereof under the postconviction relief statute (263 A2d 715). The prisoner then sought federal habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, challenging the constitutionality of his original conviction. After a full evidentiary hearing, the District Court found that the prisoner was at least of average intelligence, had been represented in the state courts by competent counsel, and had been fully aware of the possible consequences of failing to attack the validity of his conviction in the first state court proceeding. Thereupon the District Court denied relief on the grounds that (1) the prisoner had deliberately bypassed state procedures established for postconviction adjudication of the prisoner's claims, and (2) in any event, the prisoner's constitutional claims were without merit (330 F Supp 51). The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the prisoner had not waived his right to raise the constitutional issues, and that he was entitled to relief on one of the grounds asserted (458 F2d 626)."
"Maine has enacted a program of tuition assistance for parents who live in school districts that neither operate a secondary school of their own nor contract with a particular school in another district. Under that program, parents designate the secondary school they would like their child to attend, and the school district transmits payments to that school to help defray the costs of tuition. Participating private schools must meet certain requirements to be eligible to receive tuition payments, including either accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) or approval from the Maine Department of Education. But they may otherwise differ from Maine public schools in various ways. Since 1981, however, Maine has limited tuition assistance payments to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´nonsectarian‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ schools. Petitioners sought tuition assistance to send their children to Bangor Christian Schools (BCS) and Temple Academy. Although both BCS and Temple Academy are accredited by NEASC, the schools do not qualify as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´nonsectarian‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ and are thus ineligible to receive tuition payments under Maine‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s tuition assistance program. Petitioners sued the commissioner of the Maine Department of Education, alleging that the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´nonsectarian‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ requirement violated the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court rejected petitioners‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• constitutional claims and granted judgment to the commissioner. The First Circuit affirmed."
"The appellant, a physician, and Walter Waxman, a druggist, were first tried on an indictment for conspiracy to violate Title 26 United States Code Section 4705 (a), that is, to sell certain narcotic drugs, to wit, codeine, methadon, and demerol, not in pursuance of the required written orders. The result was a mistrial. Subsequently, another indictment containing fifteen counts was returned against the appellant alone, charging him with substantive violations of the same Section. The first five counts named Gerald Miller, the next five counts named Fidele Garcia, and the last five counts named Alice Buonaiuto as the persons to whom methadon was sold or caused to be sold. Except for the names of such persons and the dates of sale, all fifteen counts were identical. Without objection, the two cases were consolidated for trial. At the conclusion of the Government's evidence, the court  [**2]  granted a motion for judgment of acquittal of both defendants on the conspiracy charged, but denied Dr. Needelman's like motion on the substantive counts. The court then sustained Dr. Needelman's motion to strike all of the testimony of conversations had between the narcotic agent and Waxman outside the presence of Dr. Needelman and directed the jury to disregard any such testimony. The Government offered no additional evidence, but Dr. Needelman introduced a number of witnesses and testified in his own behalf. At the conclusion of all the evidence, Dr. Needelman again moved for judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion, stating in the jury's absence from the courtroom, 'I think this is a very slender case, offhand, but I think there is enough to go to the jury.' The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each of the fifteen counts. The court thereafter granted a motion for new trial as to the last five counts which  [*804]  named Alice Buonaiuto as the purchaser; and those counts, upon motion of the Government, were dismissed by the court. The court fined the appellant a total of $ 5,000.00 and placed him on probation for three years. n1 After the  [**3]  mistrial on the conspiracy charge, but prior to the time of the consolidated trial, the appellant moved the court:"
"Section 202(n) of the Social Security Act provides for termination of benefits payable to, or in certain cases in respect of, an alien deported on the ground, inter alia, of Communist Party membership. An alien who was denied social security benefits on the ground of his deportation for Communist Party membership unsuccessfully sought administrative reversal of the denial, and then instituted the instant suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The District Court held the statute unconstitutional under the due process clause in that it deprived the alien of an accrued property right (169 F Supp 922)."
"Three named plaintiffs brought class action claims against Google for alleged violations of the Stored Communications Act. The parties negotiated a settlement agreement that would require Google to include certain disclosures on some of its webpages and would distribute more than $ 5 million to cy pres recipients, more than $ 2 million to class counsel, and no money to absent class members.

Google operates an Internet search engine. The search engine allows users to search for a word or phrase by typing a query into the Google website. Google returns a list of webpages that are relevant to the indicated term or phrase. The complaints alleged that when an Internet user conducted a Google search and clicked on a hyperlink to open one of the webpages listed on the search results page, Google transmitted information including the terms of the search to the server that hosted the selected webpage. This so-called referrer header told the server that the user arrived at the webpage by searching for particular terms on Google's website.
Paloma Gaos challenged Google's use of referrer headers. She filed a complaint in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and a putative class of people who conducted a Google search and clicked on any of the resulting links within a certain time period. Gaos alleged that Google's transmission of users' search terms in referrer headers violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 2701 et seq. The SCA prohibits ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ from ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 2702(a)(1). The Act also creates a private right of action that entitles any ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´person aggrieved by any violation‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´recover from the person or entity, other than the United States, which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 2707(a). Gaos also asserted several state law claims.
Google moved to dismiss for lack of standing three times. Its first attempt was successful. The District Court reasoned that although ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´a plaintiff may establish standing through allegations of violation of a statutory right,‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Gaos had ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for violation of her statutory rights.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Gaos v. Google, Inc., 2011 WL 7295480, *3 (N.D. Cal., Apr. 7, 2011).

"While living on the reservation of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, an enrolled member of a second Indian tribe allegedly shot and killed, on the reservation, a member of a third Indian tribe. As a nonmember of the Pima-Maricopa tribe, the accused was not entitled to vote in Pima-Maricopa elections, to hold tribal office, or to serve on tribal juries. After the accused was charged with murder, in violation of the Major Crimes Act (18 USCS 1153), which provides federal jurisdiction over major felonies, including murder, committed by Indians in Indian country, the federal indictment against the accused was dismissed without prejudice on the motion of the United States Attorney. The accused then was placed in the custody of Pima-Maricopa officers and was taken to stand trial before the Pima-Maricopa Indian Community Court. Under the tribal criminal code, which was confined to misdemeanors, the accused was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the reservation. After the tribal court denied the accused's motion to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction, the accused filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The District Court, in granting the writ of habeas corpus, expressed the view that the assertion of jurisdiction by the tribe over an Indian who was not a member of the tribe would violate the equal protection guarantees of the Indian Civil Rights Act (25 USCS 1302 et seq.), because to subject a nonmember Indian to tribal jurisdiction, from which non-Indians were exempt, would constitute discrimination based on race. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, revising its earlier opinion in the case (821 F2d 1358), reversed the judgment of the District Court and expressed the view that Indian tribes, without regard to tribal membership, retained jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians against other Indians (851 F2d 1136). Subsequently, the Court of Appeals denied the accused's request for a rehearing (860 F2d 1463)."
"A 15-year-old boy was committed as a juvenile delinquent to the Arizona State Industrial School for the period of his minority, unless sooner discharged by due process of law, by the Juvenile Court of Gila County, Arizona, after the boy was taken into custody by the county sheriff without notice to his parents; upon going to the children's detention home, where the boy was held, the boy's mother was orally advised that he was there for making an obscene telephone call and that a hearing would be held on the following afternoon in Juvenile Court; a petition filed on the hearing day, and not served on or shown to the boy or his parents, made no reference to the factual basis for the judicial action, stating only that the boy was a delinquent minor; the complainant was not present at the hearing, where no one was sworn; the officer stated that the boy admitted making the lewd remarks after questioning out of the presence of the juvenile's parents, without counsel, and without being advised of his right to silence; and neither the boy nor his parents were notified of the boy's right to be represented by counsel and of the right to appointed counsel if they could not afford a lawyer. The boy's parents filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona. The Superior Court dismissed the petition and the Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed. (99 Ariz 181, 407 P2d 760.)"
"A Negro woman, discharged from employment on October 25, 1971, filed a charge of race discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on February 10, 1972, 84 days after her grievance under the procedures of the collective-bargaining agreement in force between her union and her former employer had been denied, but 108 days after her discharge. Upon the Commission's finding that race had not figured in the discharge, the woman brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee under 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-5), but the action was dismissed on the ground that the woman had not filed her charge with the Commission ""within ninety days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,"" 90 days being the time limitation set forth in 706 prior to its amendment on March 24, 1972, when the limitations period was extended to 180 days. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed (525 F2d 124)."
"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established online ex- changes where insurers could sell their healthcare plans. The now- expired ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Risk Corridors‚Äö√Ñ√π program aimed to limit the plans‚Äö√Ñ√¥ profits and losses during the exchanges‚Äö√Ñ√¥ first three years (2014 through 2016). See ¬¨√ü1342, 124 Stat. 211. Section 1342 set out a formula for computing a plan‚Äö√Ñ√¥s gains or losses at the end of each year, providing that eligible profitable plans ‚Äö√Ñ√∫shall pay‚Äö√Ñ√π the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), while the Secretary ‚Äö√Ñ√∫shall pay‚Äö√Ñ√π eligible unprofitable plans. The Act neither appropriated funds for these yearly payments nor limited the amounts that the Government might pay. Nor was the program required to be budget neutral. Each year, the Government owed more money to unprofitable insurers than prof- itable insurers owed to the Government, resulting in a total deficit of more than $12 billion. And at the end of each year, the appropriations bills for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in- cluded a rider preventing CMS from using the funds for Risk Corridors payments. Petitioners‚Äö√Ñ√Æfour health-insurance companies that claim losses under the program‚Äö√Ñ√Æsued the Federal Government for damages in the Court of Federal Claims. Invoking the Tucker Act, they alleged that ¬¨√ü1342 obligated the Government to pay the full amount of their losses as calculated by the statutory formula and sought a money judg- ment for the unpaid sums owed. Only one petitioner prevailed in the trial courts, and the Federal Circuit ruled for the Government in each appeal, holding that ¬¨√ü1342 had initially created a Government obliga- tion to pay the full amounts, but that the subsequent appropriations riders impliedly ‚Äö√Ñ√∫repealed or suspended‚Äö√Ñ√π that obligation."
"Eight black citizens of Burke County, Georgia, brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, alleging that the county's system of at-large election of the five county commissioners violated the constitutional and statutory rights of the county's black citizens by diluting their voting power. The District Court found that the at-large system was being maintained for discriminatory purposes, and it ordered that the county be divided into five districts for the purpose of electing county commissioners. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed (639 F2d 1358)."
"Certain provisions of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 301 et seq.) in effect between 1979 and 1983 authorized payment of survivor's benefits to a wage earner's widowed spouse who remarried after age 60 but not to a similarly situated surviving spouse who had been divorced from the decedent. A divorced widow applied for such benefits, but her claim was denied because of her remarriage. She then brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, challenging the constitutionality of the provisions, and the District Court held the challenged provisions unconstitutional, stating that because Congress in 1977 had treated surviving divorced spouses and widowed spouses in the same manner upon the wage earner's death, there was no logical basis for distinguishing between the two classes of individuals upon their subsequent remarriage."
"The alleged illegitimate son of an intestate decedent instituted an action against the decedent's administratrix in the Surrogate's Court for Westchester County, New York, for a compulsory accounting, claiming that since he and his sister had been acknowledged by the decedent as being his children, they were entitled to inherit from the decedent. The administratrix contended that even if paternity was conceded, nevertheless the children were not lawful distributees of the estate because they had not complied with a New York statute which allows an illegitimate child to inherit from his intestate father only if a court of competent jurisdiction, during the father's lifetime, has entered an order of filiation declaring paternity. Rejecting the contention that the New York statute violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating on the basis of illegitimate birth, the Surrogate's Court ruled that the alleged son was properly excluded as a distributee of the estate and therefore lacked status to petition for a compulsory accounting. The Court of Appeals of New York ultimately affirmed (43 NY2d 65, 371 NE2d 481)."
"Agreements between a natural gas pipeline company and its customers provided that all gas delivered thereunder should be paid for by the buyer under the seller's rate schedule, ""or any effective superseding rate schedules"" on file with the Federal Power Commission. The pipeline company, proceeding under 4(d) of the Natural Gas Act, filed new rate schedules with the commission. Construing the agreements as in effect constituting undertakings by the purchaser to pay the pipeline company ""going"" rates, as established from time to time in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the act, the commission refused to reject the filings of the new rate schedules as requested by the buyers. (16 FPC 19; 15 PUR3d 279.) The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed. (102 App DC 77, 250 F2d 402.) Accepting for the purposes of its decision the commission's interpretation of the service agreement, the court held that nonetheless the commission lacked jurisdiction to consider under 4(e) of the act the lawfulness of the new rate schedules, and regarded the decision of the United States Supreme Court in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v Mobile Gas Corp. 350 US 332, 100 L ed 373, 76 S Ct 373, as establishing that 4(e) applies only to rate changes whose specific amount had been mutually agreed upon between a seller and purchaser, and that in the absence of such an agreement a rate change could be effected only by action of the commission under 5(a) of the act."
"In 1971, inmates at a county jail in Suffolk County, Massachusetts sued the county sheriff, the state commissioner of corrections, the mayor of the city of Boston, and nine city councilors, claiming that inmates not yet convicted of the crimes charged against them were being held at the jail under conditions that violated the Federal Constitution. Based on its holding that conditions at the jail were constitutionally deficient, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts permanently enjoined the government officials from housing a pretrial detainee in a cell with another inmate after a certain date, and from housing any pretrial detainees at the jail after a certain later date (360 F Supp 676). In 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ordered that the jail be closed unless a plan was presented to create a constitutionally adequate facility for pretrial detainees in the county (573 F2d 98). In response to this order, the District Court was presented with a plan that formed the basis for a consent decree that was entered by the District Court in 1979. The decree, which called for construction of a new county jail that would provide inmates with single-occupancy cells, based the planned capacity of the new jail on a projected decline in inmate population. The case was later litigated in the state courts, and the government officials were ordered by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to increase the planned capacity of the jail in response to the fact that the inmate population, rather than declining as projected, had increased (394 Mass 624, 477 NE2d 361). Afterward, the District Court, in 1985, modified the consent decree to permit the capacity of the new jail to be increased in any amount so long as the jail was designed for single-cell occupancy. Subsequently, while the jail was under construction, the county sheriff, based on the increase in the population of pretrial detainees, moved, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for certain reasons, which reasons are specified (1) in Rule 60(b)(5) as (a) satisfaction, release, or discharge of the judgment, (b) reversal or vacation of a prior judgment on which the judgment is based, or (c) inequitability of continued prospective application of the judgment, and (2) in Rule 60(b)(6), as any other reason justifying such relief--to modify the consent decree to allow double bunking in some of the jail's cells. Holding that Rule 60(b)(5) codified the standard under which nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead to a change in what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned, and that the sheriff has failed to make a case for modification under the ""grievous wrong"" standard or under Rule 60(b)(6), the District Court refused to grant the requested modification (734 F Supp 561). The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court without elaboration (915 F2d 1557)."
