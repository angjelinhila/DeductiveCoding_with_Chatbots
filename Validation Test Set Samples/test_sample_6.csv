"Rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of avoiding overconcentration of broadcasting facilities, providing that licenses for television broadcasting stations would not be granted if the applicant, directly or indirectly, had an interest in more than five other stations, were attacked by a licensee whose interest in broadcasting stations had reached the limit stated in the rules"
"Two electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, while under the same management through interlocking directorates and joint officers, interchanged electrical energy under contracts establishing rates and charges which were filed with and accepted by the Federal Power Commission. The successor of one of them, having recovered liberty of action, brought suit in a Federal court for damages, alleging that by reason of the domination of its predecessor by the other company such predecessor had been paid an unreasonably low rate for electricity supplied to, and had been charged an unreasonably high rate for electricity supplied by, the other, and basing a claim of Federal jurisdiction on the provisions of the Federal Power Act that any rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is unlawful."
"After defendant was sentenced to 322 months' imprisonment in 1993, the U.S. Sentencing Commission reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses and made the amendment retroactive. Defendant filed a motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 3582(c)(2), and asked the court to grant not just the two-level reduction authorized by the amendment but a further reduction consistent with the sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 3553(a). However, the district court found that it was constrained by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1B1.10 from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range, and it resentenced defendant to 270 months' imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of the law. Section 3582(c)(2) authorized only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and required the sentencing court, pursuant to USSG ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1B1.10(b)(2), to impose a term of imprisonment that was within the amended Guidelines range unless it originally"
"An attorney who was a member of the California State Senate wished to exhibit three motion picture films, dealing with the subjects of nuclear war and acid rain, that were distributed by the National Film Board of Canada (NFBC), an agency of the Canadian Government. The United States Department of Justice identified the films as ""political propaganda"" pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended (22 USCS 611-621). The Act includes within its definition of ""political propaganda"" any communication intended to influence the foreign policies of the United States, and subjects such material to certain registration, filing, and disclosure requirements. The attorney (1) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California to enjoin the Department of Justice from applying the Act to the films, and (2) claimed that his personal, political, and professional reputation would suffer if he were to exhibit the films while they were officially characterized as ""propaganda."" The District Court, granting a motion for a preliminary injunction, held that the risk of damage to the attorney's reputation established his standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act's use of the term ""propaganda"" (569 F Supp 1513). Subsequently, the District Court granted a permanent injunction, holding that (1) ""propaganda"" was a semantically slanted word of reprobation, (2) the use of such a term rendered the regulated materials unavailable to American citizens who wished to use them as a means of personal expression, (3) there was no compelling state interest to justify the use of such a pejorative label, and therefore (4) the use of the term was an invalid abridgment of speech (619 F Supp 1111)."
"A prisoner was convicted in a Vermont court of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Since Vermont had previously closed its only maximum-security facility, he was placed in a state correctional facility which had a capacity for short term incarceration of inmates, but was not designed for long-term incarceration of inmates classified as high security risks. Because of the nature of the prisoner's offense and the length of his term, the Vermont Department of Corrections recommended that he should be incarcerated at a maximum-security prison, and determined that he be transferred to the federal prison system, such transfer being possible under a contract between Vermont and the United States pursuant to 18 USCS 5003(a). Section 5003(a) empowers the Attorney General to contract with a state for the custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and training of persons convicted of criminal offenses in the state's courts when the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons certifies that proper and adequate treatment facilities are available. Subsequently, the prisoner filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, challenging his transfer on the ground that 5003(a) requires federal authorities to make an individual determination that each state prisoner transferred under the statute needs a particular specialized treatment program available in the federal prison system. The District Court denied the prisoner's request for relief, holding (1) that 5003(a) plainly and unambiguously requires no showing of specialized treatment needs or facilities before a state prisoner may be transferred to the federal prison system in accordance with the contract under which the prisoner was so transferred, and (2) that 5003(a) requires nothing more of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons than a certification that facilities exist within the federal system in which state prisoners may be accommodated (480 F Supp 111). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (625 F2d 454)."
"Taxpayers and voters in four populous Maryland counties brought suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, challenging the apportionment of the Maryland legislature, under which a 29-member state senate was elected from 29 districts varying in population from 15,481 to 492,428, with 14.1 percent of the state's population electing a majority of the state senate, and population-per-delegate disparities in the 123-member house of delegates ranged from 6,541 to 82,071, with 24.7 percent of the state's population electing a majority of that house. The Circuit Court held unconstitutional the apportionment for the house, but refrained from passing on the validity of the senatorial apportionment. Pending an appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals from the Circuit Court's failure to rule on the senatorial apportionment, the Maryland Legislature reapportioned the house so that the population-per-delegate disparities ranged from 6,541 to 37,879, and 35.6 percent of the state's population would elect a majority of the house. The Court of Appeals later remanded the case for a decision on senatorial apportionment by the Circuit Court, which upheld the senatorial apportionment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that the appeal did not question the apportionment of the house. (229 Md 406, 184 A2d 715.)"
"A collective bargaining agreement between a union and contractors' associations and their member contractors prohibited dealings by the contractors with nonunion truck operators. The owner of a dump truck, who had not been a member of the union, joined the union under protest and paid an initiation fee, dues, and contributions to a fringe benefit plan. The dump truck owner and an association of dump truck owners filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the agreement violated both 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(e)), which prohibits hot cargo contracts, and 8(b)(4) of the Act (29 USCS 158(b)(4)), which prohibits secondary boycotts. An administrative law judge found that the union and the contractors violated 8(e) by agreeing not to do business with nonunion owner-operators, and he recommended that the Board issue a cease and desist order and that the Board order the union and the contractors to reimburse owner-operators who were compelled to join the union for amounts paid as dues, initiation fees, and fringe benefit contributions. The Board affirmed the administrative law judge's findings and adopted his recommended order except for the reimbursement provision. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit enforced the Board's order in all respects (669 F2d 759)."
"In litigation instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, a challenge was made to the validity, under the United States Constitution, of a Missouri statute setting forth conditions and limitations on abortions and establishing criminal offenses for noncompliance with the various conditions and limitations. The specific provisions of the statute attacked were (1) a viability definition provision defining ""viability,"" for purposes of a provision that no abortion not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother should be performed unless the attending physician would certify with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable, as that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems, (2) a pregnant woman's consent provision, requiring that a woman, prior to submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, must certify in writing her consent to the procedure and that her consent is informed, freely given, and not the result of coercion, (3) a spousal consent provision, requiring the prior written consent of the spouse of a woman seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless the abortion were certified by a physician to be necessary for preservation of the mother's life, (4) a parental consent provision, requiring, with respect to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy where the pregnant woman is unmarried and under 18 years of age, the written consent of a parent or person in loco parentis unless the abortion were certified by a physician as necessary for preservation of the mother's life, (5) a saline amniocentesis prohibition provision, describing the saline amniocentesis technique of abortion as one whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and a saline or other fluid is inserted into the amniotic sac, and prohibiting such method of abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, (6) recordkeeping and reporting provisions, imposing requirements upon health facilities and physicians concerned with abortions irrespective of the pregnancy stage, and (7) a standard of care provision, declaring, in its first sentence, that no person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted, and providing, in its second sentence, that any physician or person assisting in an abortion who failed to take such measures to encourage or sustain the life of the child would be deemed guilty of manslaughter if the child's death resulted. The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the several challenged provisions of the statute with the exception of the first sentence of the standard of care provision (392 F Supp 1362)."
"The McCarran Amendment (43 USCS 666(a)), enacted in 1952, provides in relevant part that (1) consent is given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit for the adjudication of rights to the use of water in a river system where it appears that the United States (a) is the owner of or is in the process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under state law, by purchase, by exchange, or otherwise, and (b) is a necessary party to such suit; and (2) when a party to such suit, the United States shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that ""the State laws"" are inapplicable or that the United States is not amenable to such laws by reason of its sovereignty, with the proviso that no ""judgment for costs"" shall be entered against the United States in any such suit. Pursuant to an Idaho statute enacted as part of legislation in 1985 and 1986 which provided for the Snake River Basin Adjudication, the director of the Idaho department of water resources filed a petition in Idaho District Court naming the United States and all other users of water from the Snake River Basin in Idaho as defendants. The Idaho legislation further provided that water users who sought to claim water rights in the Snake River Basin were required to file a notice of claim with the director. The director was not to accept a notice of claim from any water claimant unless such notice was submitted with a filing fee based on a fee schedule. Under Idaho law, the funds generated from the filing fees were to be used by Idaho to pay both state costs attributable to general water rights adjudications, and judicial expenses directly related to the Snake River Basin adjudication. The United States, which estimated that in its case the filing fees could exceed $ 10 million, attempted to submit its notices of claims unaccompanied by filing fees, but the director refused to accept them. Thereafter, the United States filed a petition in Idaho District Court for a writ of mandamus to compel the director to accept notices of claims from the United States without fees, on the ground that the McCarran Amendment did not waive federal sovereign immunity from payment of filing fees. The District Court granted Idaho summary judgment on the immunity issue. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Idaho, affirming, expressed the view that (1) the McCarran Amendment expressed a clear intent to subject the United States to all of the state court processes of an adjudication of its water rights with the sole exception of costs; and (2) the term ""judgment for costs"" in the McCarran Amendment did not include filing fees (122 Idaho 116, 832 P2d 289)."
"In a prosecution for wilful attempt to evade income taxes, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island conducted an in camera examination of government records of electronic surveillance and determined that the government had correctly identified the defendant's voice and had turned over to him the records of the surveillance of each conversation in which he had participated. Holding that the District Court was justified in concluding that no evidence or leads affecting the defendant's trial were generated by the electronic surveillance, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed his conviction (398 F2d 558)."
"Employees whose collective bargaining contract contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration of differences as to the meaning and application of the contract and specifying that the employer was obliged to reinstate and compensate for lost pay an employee found by an arbitrator to have been suspended or discharged in violation of the contract, brought an action to compel the employer to arbitrate a grievance as to the discharge of employees who left their jobs in protest against the discharge of another employee. The court ordered arbitration, and the arbitrator found that the employees were entitled to reinstatement and back pay; he rejected the contention that expiration of the collective bargaining agreement between the time of the discharge of the employees and the time he made his award barred the award. On the employer's refusal to comply with the award, the employees moved the United States District for the Southern District of West Virginia for enforcement, and the District Court directed the employer to comply (168 F Supp 308). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit modified the District Court's judgment, holding that an award for back pay and for reinstatement subsequent to the date of termination of the collective bargaining agreement could not be enforced (269 F2d 327)."
"In 1990, a city agency administrator in Fall River, Massachusetts, received a complaint that an employee had made racial and ethnic slurs. The administrator prepared termination charges against the employee, who allegedly pressed her case with several state and local officials, including the vice president of the city council. The council held a hearing on the charges and ultimately accepted a settlement proposal under which the employee was to be suspended without pay for 60 days. The mayor of Fall River subsequently reduced the punishment. While the charges against the employee were pending, the mayor (1) prepared his budget proposal for the 1992 fiscal year, and (2) proposed eliminating 135 city positions, including that of the administrator. The council's ordinance committee, chaired by the vice president, approved an ordinance eliminating the administrator's agency. The council adopted the ordinance by a vote of 6 to 2, with the vice president among those voting in favor. The mayor signed the ordinance into law. The administrator filed suit under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the city, the mayor, the vice president, and several other city officials, in which suit it was alleged that the elimination of the administrator's position was motivated by racial animus and a desire to retaliate against the administrator for exercising her rights under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment in filing the complaint against the employee. The District Court denied motions by the mayor and the vice president to dismiss on the basis of legislative immunity, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found defendants including the mayor and the vice president liable on the First Amendment claim. On a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the District Court again denied the mayor's and the vice president's immunity claims, on the ground that the ordinance was an individually targeted administrative act, rather than a neutral and legislative elimination of a position that incidentally resulted in the administrator's termination. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, affirming the District Court's judgment in pertinent part, reasoned that (1) constitutionally sheltered speech was a substantial or motivating factor underlying the mayor's and the vice president's conduct, and (2) such conduct was administrative rather than legislative in nature (1997 US App LEXIS 594)."
"Some six years after his trial and conviction for felony murder, a state prisoner in Louisiana who had not appealed his conviction sought collateral relief from a Louisiana state court on the ground that Negroes were excluded from the grand jury that had indicted him, notwithstanding that no objection to the composition of the grand jury had been made by the prisoner before trial as required by a Louisiana law which provided that any objection by a defendant to the composition of the grand jury that indicted him had to be made in advance of trial and that otherwise all such objections would be considered waived and not afterwards heard. Following the state court's denial of relief because of the prisoner's having waived his claim, the prisoner sought a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 USCS 2254 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The District Court granted the writ on the ground that Negroes had been impermissibly excluded from the grand jury, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Louisiana waiver provision had to be given effect unless there was a showing of actual prejudice (496 F2d 896)."
"In litigation instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, a challenge was made to the validity, under the United States Constitution, of a Missouri statute setting forth conditions and limitations on abortions and establishing criminal offenses for noncompliance with the various conditions and limitations.

The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the several challenged provisions of the statute with the exception of the first sentence of the standard of care provision (392 F Supp 1362)."
"The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for consideration in light of Coppedge v. United States, ante, p. 438."
"Responding to reports of a possible drunk driver, officers of a Montana county sheriff's department discovered a car in a ditch along a highway. In the front seat of the car were two persons who had each been killed with a single gunshot to the head. In the rear of the car was an individual who was yelling obscenities. The individual's handgun, with four loaded rounds and two empty casings, was found on the floor of the car, and the individual was found to have gunshot residue on his hands. More than an hour later, the individual's blood-alcohol content was .36 percent. The individual was charged with two counts of deliberate homicide, which was defined under Montana law as purposely or knowingly causing the death of another human being. At trial in a Montana state court, the individual's defense was that his extreme intoxication rendered him physically incapable of committing the murders and accounted for his inability to recall the events of the night that the murders were committed. Pursuant to a Montana statute, the jury was instructed that it could not consider the individual's intoxicated condition in determining the existence of a mental state which was an element of the offense. The jury found the individual guilty on both counts. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Montana, reversing, expressed the view that (1) the individual had a right, under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, to present and have considered by the jury all relevant evidence of the offense charged; (2) evidence of the individual's voluntary intoxication was relevant to the issue whether the individual acted knowingly and purposely; and (3) because the Montana statute prevented the jury from considering that evidence with regard to such issue, the individual had been denied due process in that Montana had been relieved of part of its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged (272 Mont 114, 900 P2d 260).."
"A District Court appointed an equity receiver for a corporation and suspended payment of its debts. The equity receivership was succeeded by reorganization proceedings under _ 77B of the Bankruptcy Act and later by a Chapter X proceeding. The District Court held the first mortgage bondholders entitled to interest on interest accruing after the receivership, on the theory that the validity of the covenant therefor was determined by New York law and that it was valid thereunder."
Defendants whose convictions were affirmed by various United States Courts of Appeals claimed that their convictions were invalid because of the government's use of illegal electronic surveillance.
"In McMillan v Pennsylvania (1986) 477 US 79, 91 L Ed 2d 67, 106 S Ct 2411, the United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment was not violated by a state statute which provided that anyone convicted of certain felonies was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years' imprisonment if a sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the offender had visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense. However, in Jones v United States (1999) 526 US 227, 143 L Ed 2d 311, 119 S Ct 1215, the Supreme Court--partly in order to avoid what the court indicated would be doubts under the due process clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment and under the notice and jury-trial guarantees of the Constitution's Sixth Amendments--construed the federal carjacking statute (18 USCS 2119, later amended) to define (1) three separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements, each of which had to be charged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict; rather than (2) a single crime with three maximum penalties, two of which would be dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of charge and jury verdict. Moreover, in Apprendi v New Jersey (2000) 530 US 466, 147 L Ed 2d 435, 120 S Ct 2348, the Supreme Court held that a state statutory scheme could not stand under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, where the state scheme (1) allowed a jury to convict a defendant of a second-degree offense on the basis of the jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had unlawfully possessed a prohibited weapon; and (2) after a subsequent and separate proceeding, allowed a judge to impose a punishment, identical to that which the state provided for crimes of the first degree, through the judge's finding that the defendant had a specified ""hate crime"" purpose for unlawfully possessing the weapon. A federal indictment charged an accused, who had supposedly sold illegal narcotics out of his pawnshop with an unconcealed pistol at his side, with violating statutes including 18 USCS 924(c)(1)(a), which provided in relevant part that any person who used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime would, in addition to the punishment for such crime, ""(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm [was] brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm [was] discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years."" With respect to 924(c)(1)(a), the indictment alleged that the accused had knowingly carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, but alleged nothing about brandishing. At a bench trial, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina found the accused guilty as charged. Subsequently, at a sentencing hearing, the District Court (1) overruled the accused's objection that as a matter of statutory interpretation, brandishing ought to be considered an element of a separate offense for which the accused had not been indicted or tried; (2) found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused had brandished the pistol; and (3) sentenced him to 7 years in prison."
"An action for damages was brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 USCS 1983 against two State University of New York police officers based on the officers' alleged deprivation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights through an unlawful arrest and beating by the officers 22 months before the complaint was filed. The District Court, denying the defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by New York's 1-year statute of limitations covering the intentional torts of assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, libel, slander, false words causing special damages, and violation of the right of privacy, held that 1983 actions brought in the state were governed by the state's 3-year residual statute of limitations for personal injury claims that were not embraced by specific statutes of limitation (625 F Supp 1568). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed both the denial of the motion to dismiss and the holding that the 3-year residual statute of limitations governed 1983 actions brought in the state (816 F2d 45)."
"The lower appellate court found that the state statute of conviction covered aiding and abetting a theft, which was outside the generic definition of theft and thus was beyond the scope of the federal immigration statutes for purposes of removal. The alien argued that the state rendered an aider and abettor criminally responsible not only for the crime he intended, but also for any crime that naturally and probably resulted from the intended crime, and thus the state criminalized conduct other than generic theft. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the term ""theft offense"" in ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1101(a)(43)(G) included the crime of aiding and abetting a theft offense, since every state and federal jurisdiction abrogated the distinction between principals and aiders and abettors and thus aiding and abetting was within the definition of generic theft. Further, the state's extension of potential criminal liability to unintended natural and probable consequences of an intended crime did not by itself establish a realistic probability, rather than a theoretical possibility, that the state statute would be applied to conduct outside generic theft."
"Upon trial in the Circuit Court of Calhoun County, Alabama, the defendant was convicted of rape, and the conviction was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama (57 Ala App 164, 326 So 2d 692). Thereafter, the defendant sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, contending that his constitutional rights had been violated at his state trial because the in-court identification of him by the prosecuting witness was the product of an out-of-court identification at an impermissibly suggestive photographic array and a later uncounseled lineup. The District Court refused to entertain the claim, concluding that since the reported opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirming the conviction did not refer to the constitutional claim, such claim had never been presented to any state court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the defendant's pro se application for a certificate of probable cause and for leave to appeal in forma pauperis."
"Title II of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (the Reform Act) (8 USCS 1151 et seq.) created a program allowing certain illegal aliens to apply, during the 12-month period beginning on May 5, 1987, for temporary resident status. An applicant for temporary resident status was required, under 8 USCS 1255a(a)(2)(A), to have resided unlawfully in the United States continuously since at least January 1, 1982, but 8 USCS 1255a(g)(2)(A) provided that certain brief trips abroad would not break such continuity. Similarly, an applicant for temporary resident status was required, under 8 USCS 1255a(a)(3)(A), to have been physically present in the United States continuously since November 6, 1986, but 8 USCS 1255a(a)(3)(B) provided that brief, casual, and innocent absences would not break such continuity. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) promulgated a regulation, 8 CFR 245a.1(g), providing that any absence without ""advance parole""--that is, INS permission before leaving the United States--would not be considered brief, casual, and innocent, and a regulation, 8 CFR 245a.2(b)(8), providing that an alien would fail the requirement of continuous unlawful residence if the alien had gone abroad and re-entered the United States by presenting facially valid documentation to immigration authorities. An organization representing aliens brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California challenging 245a.1(g) as an impermissible construction of the Reform Act. After certifying the case as a class action and defining a class comprising persons prima facie eligible for legalization under 1255a who departed and re-entered the United States without INS authorization after the enactment of the Reform Act following what the persons assert to have been a brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States, the District Court granted the organization a summary judgment invalidating 245a.1(g) (688 F Supp 1149). The INS did not appeal that judgment, and subsequently, the District Court issued three remedial orders, one of which required the INS to extend the temporary-resident application period to November 30, 1988, for class members who did not file an application because the members concluded, based on 245a.1(g), that they were ineligible for legalization, and all of which orders the INS appealed. A second organization representing aliens brought an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, challenging 245a.2(b)(8) as inconsistent with the Reform Act and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The District Court certified the case as a class action, with a class including all persons who qualified for legalization but were deemed ineligible under 245a.2(b)(8)'s re-entry policy, who learned of their ineligibility following promulgation of the policy, and who, relying upon information that they were ineligible, did not apply for legalization before the May 4, 1988, deadline. After that date, the District Court held 245a.2(b)(8) invalid, while reserving the question of remedy. The INS did not appeal that judgment, and subsequently, the District Court issued an order granting the organization's request for injunctive relief extending the 12-month application period, which order the INS appealed. In its appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in each case, the INS argued that the judicial review provisions of the Reform Act barred District Court jurisdiction over the organization's claim, and that the 12-month application period was a substantive statutory restriction on relief that was beyond the power of a court to alter. The Court of Appeals consolidated the two appeals and affirmed the judgments of the District Courts (956 F2d 914)."
"One who failed the Arizona bar examination brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against members of the Arizona Supreme Court's Committee on Examinations and Admissions, alleging that the committee members had conspired to restrain trade in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act by artificially reducing the numbers of competing attorneys in the state of Arizona through setting the bar examination grading scale with reference to the number of new attorneys sought desirable rather than with reference to some suitable level of competence. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a justiciable claim, and that the plaintiff lacked standing. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the committee members, in order to secure state action immunity from the federal antitrust laws, must show that they were acting pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy (686 F2d 692)."
"At defendant's trial upon a charge of having violated the Mann Act (18 USC 2421) by transporting a girl from one state into another for immoral purposes, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, over defendant's objection, permitted the government to use his wife as a witness against him. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that this was not error. (249 F2d 735.)"

One such right of way, obtained by a railroad in 1908, crosses land that the United States conveyed to the Brandt family in a 1976 land patent. That patent stated, as relevant here, that the land was granted subject to the railroad's rights in the 1875 Act right of way, but it did not specify what would occur if the railroad later relinquished those rights. Years later, a successor railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval. The Government then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an order quieting title in the United States to the abandoned right of way, including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the Brandt patent. Petitioners contested the claim, asserting that the right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the railroad abandoned it, so that Brandt now enjoys full title to his land without the burden of the easement. The Government countered that the 1875 Act granted the railroad something more than a mere easement, and that the United States retained a reversionary interest in that land once the railroad abandoned it. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Government and quieted title in the United States to the right of way. The Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"In 1971, inmates at a county jail in Suffolk County, Massachusetts sued the county sheriff, the state commissioner of corrections, the mayor of the city of Boston, and nine city councilors, claiming that inmates not yet convicted of the crimes charged against them were being held at the jail under conditions that violated the Federal Constitution. Based on its holding that conditions at the jail were constitutionally deficient, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts permanently enjoined the government officials from housing a pretrial detainee in a cell with another inmate after a certain date, and from housing any pretrial detainees at the jail after a certain later date (360 F Supp 676). In 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ordered that the jail be closed unless a plan was presented to create a constitutionally adequate facility for pretrial detainees in the county (573 F2d 98). In response to this order, the District Court was presented with a plan that formed the basis for a consent decree that was entered by the District Court in 1979. The decree, which called for construction of a new county jail that would provide inmates with single-occupancy cells, based the planned capacity of the new jail on a projected decline in inmate population. The case was later litigated in the state courts, and the government officials were ordered by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to increase the planned capacity of the jail in response to the fact that the inmate population, rather than declining as projected, had increased (394 Mass 624, 477 NE2d 361). Afterward, the District Court, in 1985, modified the consent decree to permit the capacity of the new jail to be increased in any amount so long as the jail was designed for single-cell occupancy. Subsequently, while the jail was under construction, the county sheriff, based on the increase in the population of pretrial detainees, moved, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for certain reasons, which reasons are specified (1) in Rule 60(b)(5) as (a) satisfaction, release, or discharge of the judgment, (b) reversal or vacation of a prior judgment on which the judgment is based, or (c) inequitability of continued prospective application of the judgment, and (2) in Rule 60(b)(6), as any other reason justifying such relief--to modify the consent decree to allow double bunking in some of the jail's cells. Holding that Rule 60(b)(5) codified the standard under which nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead to a change in what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned, and that the sheriff has failed to make a case for modification under the ""grievous wrong"" standard or under Rule 60(b)(6), the District Court refused to grant the requested modification (734 F Supp 561). The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court without elaboration (915 F2d 1557)."
"The named representatives of a class of undocumented and unadmitted aliens from Haiti brought suit against the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in a Federal District Court, alleging in part that they had been detained without parole by INS officials on the basis of race and national origin, in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The District Court rejected the constitutional claim (544 F Supp 973), but a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantee applied to the parole of unadmitted aliens (711 F2d 1455). After a rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals held that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to the consideration of unadmitted aliens for parole. Although rejecting the constitutional claim, the Court of Appeals accorded relief based on the applicable INS regulation ( 8 CFR 212.5), remanding to the District Court to ensure that the INS exercised its discretion in making parole decisions in an individualized and nondiscriminatory manner (727 F2d 957)."
"Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan. The plan must provide for full payment of priority claims. 11 U. S. C. ¬¨√ü1222(a)(2). Under ¬¨√ü1222(a)(2)(A), however, certain governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of priority status and downgraded to general, unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less than full payment. That exception applies only to claims ""entitled to priority under [11 U. S. C. ¬¨√ü507]"" in the first place. As relevant here, ¬¨√ü507(a)(2) covers ""administrative expenses allowed under ¬¨√ü503(b),"" which includes ""any tax ... incurred by the estate."" ¬¨√ü503(b)(B)(i). Petitioners filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their farm. They proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from the sale. Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance being discharged. The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 U. S. C. ¬¨√ü¬¨√ü1398, 1399, it does not ""incur"" postpetition federal income taxes. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the tax was not ""incurred by the estate"" under ¬¨√ü503(b), it was not a priority claim eligible for the ¬¨√ü1222(a)(2)(A) exception."
"Congress, having found that differing minimum drinking ages in the states created particular incentives for young persons to drink and drive while commuting to border states where the drinking age was lower, enacted the National Minimum Drinking Age Amendment of 1984 (23 USCS 158). The statute directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of otherwise allocable federal highway funds from states in which the purchase or public possession of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than 21 years of age is lawful. The state of South Dakota, which permits persons 19 years of age or older to purchase beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol, brought suit against the Secretary of Transportation in United States District Court. South Dakota sought a declaratory judgment that 158 was an invalid exercise of Congress' power under the Federal Constitution's spending clause (Art I, 8, cl 1) and also violated the Federal Constitution's Twenty-first Amendment, which reserves power to the states to impose restrictions on the sale of liquor. The District Court rejected the state's claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (791 F2d 628)."
