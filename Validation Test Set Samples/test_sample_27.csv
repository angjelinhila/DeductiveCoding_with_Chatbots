"In approving a plan for the reorganization of a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Securities and Exchange Commission required that preferred stock purchased by the management without fraud or concealment while plans of reorganization were before the Commission should not be converted into stock of the reorganized company, like other preferred stock, but should be surrendered at cost plus interest. In S. E. C. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, this Court held that this requirement could not be sustained on the sole ground upon which it was based by the Commission -- i. e., principles of equity judicially established. On remand, the Commission re-examined the problem and reached the same result, but based this requirement on the ground that to permit the management to profit from purchases of stock made while reorganization proceedings were pending would be inconsistent with the standards of __ 7 and 11 of the Act. Held: The new order is sustained."
"South Carolina prison inmates who claimed that they had been unnecessarily beaten by prison guards during a prison uprising sought criminal arrest warrants against the guards from a state court magistrate. After the magistrate expressed his intent to issue the warrants, the state solicitor--as a result of a meeting with the legal advisor to the state's department of corrections, the prison warden, the county sheriff, and deputy attorney--wrote the magistrate a letter which requested that the warrants not be issued and stated that the solicitor intended to ask state officials to conduct an investigation concerning the charges made against the officers involved. The magistrate did not issue the warrants, and no investigation was conducted. The inmates subsequentely filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina contending, among other claims, that the state correctional officials had conspired in bad faith to block the issuance of the arrest warrants and thereby violated 42 USCS 1983 and 1985(3). The District Court ultimately concluded that the state correctional officials denied the inmates their right to a meaningful ability to set in motion the governmental machinery, because the officials' activity stopped the machinery unlawfully, not in a proper way, as for example, upon a valid determination of lack of probable cause, and the court awarded the inmates compensatory and punitive damages. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that even though a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another, that did not foreclose the inmates' right to seek an arrest warrant."
"Investigating a tip that the accused was growing marijuana plants in his backyard, and finding that they could not observe anything from ground level because the accused's yard was surrounded by a 6-foot outer fence and a 10-foot inner fence, police officers secured a private plane, flew over the yard at an altitude of 1,000 feet, and made naked-eye observations which provided the basis for a search warrant. After a California trial court denied the accused's motion to suppress the plants seized in the ensuing search, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating marijuana. The California Court of Appeal, First District, reversed, holding that this warrantless aerial surveillance of the curtilage of the accused's home violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeal distinguished cases allowing warrantless aerial surveillance of open fields, ruled that the height and existence of the fences demonstrated the accused's reasonable expectation of privacy by any standard, and found it significant that the surveillance had not been the result of a routine patrol but had been conducted for the express purpose of observing this enclosure within the accused's curtilage (161 Cal App 3d 1081, 208 Cal Rptr 93)."
"In January 1983, a woman lost control of her car as she traveled down a Missouri road. The car overturned, and a state trooper discovered the woman, lying face down in a ditch, without detectable respiratory or cardiac function. Paramedics who arrived at the accident scene were able to restore the woman's breathing and heartbeat, and the woman was then transported to a hospital in an unconscious state. An attending neurosurgeon diagnosed the woman as having sustained probable cerebral contusions compounded by significant oxygen deprivation, or anoxia. The estimated length of the period of her anoxia was 12 to 14 minutes; permanent brain damage generally results, the trial court later found, after 6 minutes in an anoxic state. The woman remained in a coma for approximately 3 weeks, and then progressed to an unconscious state in which she was able to orally ingest some nutrition. In order to ease feeding and further the woman's recovery, surgeons implanted a gastrostomy feeding and hydration tube with the consent of her then husband. In October 1983, the woman was admitted to a state hospital. Subsequent rehabilitative efforts proved unavailing. After it became apparent that the woman had virtually no chance of regaining her mental faculties, her parents--who had been appointed as her coguardians--asked employees of the state hospital to terminate the artificial nutrition and hydration procedures. The employees refused to honor the request without court approval. The parents then filed a declaratory judgment action in a Missouri trial court, in which they sought judicial authorization of their request. A guardian ad litem was appointed for the woman. The trial court, following a hearing, entered an order directing the employees to cause the parents' request to be carried out, based upon its findings that (1) the woman (a) had unassisted respiration and circulation function within the normal limits of a 30-year-old female, (b) was oblivious to her environment except for reflexive responses to sound and perhaps to painful stimuli, (c) suffered anoxia of the brain resulting in a massive enlargement of the ventricles filling with cerebrospinal fluid where the brain had degenerated, and cerebral cortical atrophy which was irreversible, permanent, progressive, and ongoing, (d) exhibited her highest cognitive brain function by grimacing, perhaps in recognition of ordinarily painful stimuli, which indicated the experience of pain and apparent response to sound, (e) was a spastic quadriplegic, (f) suffered contracture of her four extremities, with irreversible muscle and tendon damage, and (g) had no cognitive or reflex ability to swallow food or water to maintain her daily essential needs, and would never recover such ability; (2) a person in the woman's condition had a fundamental right under the Missouri and Federal Constitutions to refuse or direct the withdrawal of ""death prolonging procedures""; and (3) the woman's expressed thoughts at age 25, in somewhat serious conversation with her housemate, that if sick or injured, she would not wish to continue her life unless she could live at least halfway normally, suggested that the woman would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration given her present condition. Both the state and the guardian ad litem appealed. The Supreme Court of Missouri, reversing, expressed the view that (1) although the woman was in a ""persistent vegetative state,"" she was neither dead within the meaning of Missouri's statutory definition of death nor terminally ill; (2) the woman's right to refuse treatment--whether such right proceeded from a constitutional right of privacy or a common-law right to refuse treatment--did not outweigh Missouri's strong policy favoring the preservation of life, as embodied in the Missouri living will statute; (3) the woman's conversation with her housemate was unreliable for the purpose of determining her intent, and thus insufficient to support the parents' claim to exercise substituted judgment on the woman's behalf; and (4) no person could assume the choice of terminating medical treatment for an incompetent person in the absence of either the formalities required under the living will statute or ""clear and convincing, inherently reliable evidence,"" which was absent in the case at hand (760 SW2d 408)."
"Separate actions instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico presented the question whether the provisions of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 1382(f), 1382c(e)) which limit the payment of benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program to residents of the states and the District of Columbia violated the constitutional right to travel of persons who, upon moving to Puerto Rico, lost the right to benefits that they had been receiving while residing in the United States. In the first case (No. 77-88), a three-judge District Court held that the Act's geographic limitations were unconstitutional as applied to beneficiaries who moved to Puerto Rico (426 F Supp 1106). In the second case (No. 77-126), a single judge relied on the decision in the first case in enjoining the Social Security Administration from discontinuing benefits on the basis of the change of a beneficiary's residence to Puerto Rico."
"Pennsylvania residents and taxpayers sued the state treasurer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the operation of the Pennsylvania Parent Reimbursement Act for Nonpublic Education, which provided funds to reimburse parents for part of tuition expenses incurred in sending their children to nonpublic schools. On the ground that the statute violates the First Amendment's establishment clause (340 F Supp 1356), a three-judge court permanently enjoined the disbursement of any funds under the Act"
"An allegedly obese student was accepted into the nursing program at a Rhode Island college, but questions were subsequently raised as to the effect of her weight on her ability to complete the clinical requirements safely and satisfactorily, and the student was impelled to sign a ""contract"" conditioning her further participation in the program upon her attendance at weight-loss seminars and a specified average weekly weight loss. When the student failed to meet these commitments, she was asked to leave the program, and she transferred to another institution where she completed her nursing education, taking a year longer than would otherwise have been required. After leaving the program, the student filed a diversity-jurisdiction lawsuit against the college in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, which suit, governed by the substantive law of Rhode Island, asserted, among other claims, that the college had failed to fulfill its implied agreement to educate the student. The District Court denied the college's motion for a directed verdict on the breach of contract claim, as the District Court Judge, relying in part on his more than 18 years of experience as a Rhode Island state trial judge, concluded as a matter of law that (1) the Supreme Court of Rhode Island would apply the doctrine of substantial performance, previously applied in Rhode Island to only construction contracts, to the facts of the case at hand, and (2) there was a legitimate factual issue as to whether there had been substantial performance by the student in her overall contractual relationship with the college. The breach of contract claim was submitted to the jury with a substantial-performance instruction, and a verdict was returned in favor of the student on that claim. In affirming the District Court's judgment, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, referring to the ""customary appellate deference"" accorded to interpretations of state law made by federal judges of that state, held that the District Court's determination that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island would apply standard contract principles to the case was not reversible error (890 F2d 484)."
"Shortly after his arrest in connection with a robbery, the 18-year-old accused was taken to an interrogation room for questioning by two police detectives. When the detectives informed him that he had a right to his counsel's presence at the interrogation, the accused responded ""Uh, yeah. I'd like to do that."" Despite this response, the detectives continued with their questioning, and when they subsequently asked the accused whether he wished to talk to them without a lawyer being present, the accused responded ""Yeah and no, uh, I don't know what's what, really,"" and ""All right. I'll talk to you then."" The accused then told the detectives that he knew in advance about the planned robbery but claimed that he was not a participant. After considerable probing by the detectives, the accused confessed that ""I committed it,"" but he then returned to his earlier story that he only knew about the planned crime. Upon further questioning, the accused again insisted for a lawyer saying ""I wanta get a lawyer,"" and this time the detectives honored the request and terminated the interrogation. At his trial for armed robbery in an Illinois Circuit Court, the accused moved to suppress his incriminating statements, but the trial judge denied the motion, and the accused was subsequently convicted. In affirming the accused's conviction, the Illinois Appellate Court acknowledged that the accused's first request for counsel when he said ""Uh, yeah. I'd like to do that"" appears clear and unequivocal, but it concluded that when the request is considered with other statements, the accused was undecided about exercising his right to counsel and never made an effective request for counsel (113 Ill App 3d 305, 69 Ill Dec 339, 447 NE2d 556). The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that the accused's responses to continued police questioning rendered his initial request for counsel ambiguous and that the officers therefore were not required to terminate their questioning (102 Ill 2d 365, 80 Ill Dec 784, 466 NE2d 236)."
"These three cases presented the question as to the proper allocation, for determining an insurance company's right to preferential income tax treatment as a life insurance company, of unearned premium reserves for accident and health insurance policies covered by reinsurance treaties (agreements) between insurance companies. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides that to qualify as a life insurance company, a taxpayer must have life insurance reserves constituting more than 50% of its ""total reserves"" (26 USCS 801(a)), and the term ""total reserves"" is defined as including life insurance reserves, unearned premiums not included in life insurance reserves, and all other insurance reserves required by law (26 USCS 801(c)). In the instant cases, the reinsurance treaties between the taxpayers and other parties assumed two basic forms whereby, under one form, the taxpayer served as reinsurer and the other party was the primary insurer, and under the other form, the taxpayer served as the primary insurer and the other party was the reinsurer, with the other party, in both forms of treaties, holding the unearned premiums and setting up on its books the corresponding unearned premium reserve even though the taxpayer assumed all substantial insurance risks. In each of the cases, the taxpayers and the other parties to the treaties filed annual reports reflecting such premium reserve treatment with state insurance authorities and with the Internal Revenue Service. While the state authorities accepted the reports without criticism, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the nonlife insurance reserves should be attributed to the ""total reserves"" of the taxpayers, thus disqualifying them from preferential tax treatment as life insurance companies. In two of the cases, the taxpayers paid deficiencies assessed by the Commissioner and then brought suits for refunds in the Court of Claims, which held for the taxpayer in each case ( No. 75-1221, 207 Ct Cl 638, 524 F2d 1167; No. 75-1285, 207 Ct Cl 594, 524 F2d 1155). In the third case (No. 75-1260), the taxpayer paid the deficiency assessment and then brought a suit for refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, which held for the taxpayer, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed (514 F2d 675)."
"The United States sells alcoholic beverages to military personnel and their families in clubs and package stores on its military bases within the United States and uses the revenue from those sales to support a morale, welfare, and recreation program for personnel and their families. The Federal Government and the state of North Dakota exercised concurrent jurisdiction over two military bases located within the state. Effective in 1986, Congress (1) generally eliminated a prior in-state purchasing requirement, and (2) in 10 USCS 2488(a), generally directed, with some exceptions, that distilled spirits for such military club and package store sales had to be procured from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered. In addition, a Department of Defense regulation ( 32 CFR 261.4) provides that such liquor procurement shall obtain for the government the most advantageous contract, price and other factors considered. North Dakota's alcoholic-beverage-regulation program, however, has required (1) since 1978, that all persons bringing liquor into the state must file monthly reports documenting the volume of liquor imported (the ""reporting requirement""); and (2) since 1986, that out-of-state distillers who sell liquor directly to a federal enclave must affix labels to each individual item, which labels shall indicate that the liquor is for domestic consumption within only the federal enclave (the ""labeling requirement""). The United States instituted an action against defendants including the state in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota and sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the application of the state's regulations to liquor destined for federal enclaves. The District Court, however, granting the state's motion for summary judgment and denying the United States' cross motion for summary judgment, reasoned that there was no conflict between the state and federal regulations (675 F Supp 555). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that (1) the Federal Constitution's Twenty-First Amendment, which generally authorizes a state to regulate the importation of liquor into the state, provided no basis for regulation in the circumstances of the case at hand; and (2) even if the Twenty-First Amendment extended jurisdiction over the subject matter to North Dakota, the state's reporting and labeling requirements were pre-empted under the Constitution's supremacy clause (Art VI, cl 2), for the two requirements were in conflict with federal policy (856 F2d 1107)."
"Petitioners were wholly owned subsidiaries of a parent corporation which utilized them as operating companies in the manufacture and sale of products. They operated strictly in accord with contracts with the parent which provided, inter alia, that the subsidiaries were employed as agents of the parent, that the parent would furnish working capital, and that all profits in excess of six percent on their capitalization (which was nominal) would be paid to the parent. Title to the assets utilized by the subsidiaries was held by them, and advances by the parent of working capital were shown on the books of the subsidiaries as accounts payable to the parent."
"An unsuccessful candidate for union office and several other individuals brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging a union ""outsider rule""--which prohibited candidates for union office from accepting campaign contributions from nonmembers--on the ground that the rule violated the members' ""right to sue"" under 101(a)(4) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (29 USCS 411(a)(4)), the candidate contending that the rule prohibited outside contributions to finance campaign-related litigation. The District Court found that the rule violated the ""right to sue"" provision (507 F Supp 623). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the rule violated the ""right to sue"" provision and further accepting the candidate's argument, first raised on appeal, that the outsider rule also violated the ""free speech and assembly"" guarantee of 101(a)(2) of the Act (29 USCS 411(a)(2)). The Court of Appeals rejected the union's contention that even if the rule interfered with rights protected by the Act it was sheltered by the proviso to 101(a)(2), which gives a union authority to adopt ""reasonable"" rules regarding the responsibilities of its members (207 App DC 189, 645 F2d 1114)."
"After defendant was sentenced to 322 months' imprisonment in 1993, the U.S. Sentencing Commission reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses and made the amendment retroactive. Defendant filed a motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 3582(c)(2), and asked the court to grant not just the two-level reduction authorized by the amendment but a further reduction consistent with the sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 3553(a). However, the district court found that it was constrained by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 1B1.10 from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range, and it resentenced defendant to 270 months' imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of the law. Section 3582(c)(2) authorized only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and required the sentencing court, pursuant to USSG ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 1B1.10(b)(2), to impose a term of imprisonment that was within the amended Guidelines range unless it originally"
"For several years an automobile manufacturer has provided in-plant food services, which include cafeterias and vending machines, to its employees. While the services are managed by an independent caterer, the manufacturer has the right to review and approve the quality, quantity, and price of the food served. Following the manufacturer's announcement of an increase in cafeteria and vending machine prices, the union representing its employees at a particular plant requested bargaining over both prices and services. After its request was refused, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging a refusal to bargain contrary to 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(a)(5)). Section 8(d) of the Act (29 USCS 158(d)) defines the duty of management and unions to bargain under 8(a)(5) as the mutual obligation to meet at reasonable times and to confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and ""other terms and conditions of employment."" The Board sustained the union's charge, holding that prices of in-plant food and beverages are generally mandatory bargaining subjects as ""terms and conditions of employment"" (230 NLRB 716). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit enforced the Board's order to bargain (571 F2d 993)."
"Petitioners were convicted of violating _ 2 of Act 193 of the Arkansas Acts of 1943, which makes it unlawful ""for any person acting in concert with one or more other persons, to assemble at or near any place where a 'labor dispute' exists and by force or violence prevent or attempt to prevent any person from engaging in any lawful vocation, or for any person acting either by himself, or as a member of any group or organization or acting in concert with one or more other persons, to promote, encourage or aid any such unlawful assemblage."" The State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, indicating in its opinion that as to one charged with violation of the italicized portion, the statute requires that the accused shall have aided the assemblage with the intention that force and violence would be used to prevent a person from working."
"Under 18 USCS 924(a)(1)(D), a fine, imprisonment not more than 5 years, or both, may be imposed against anyone who ""willfully"" violates certain provisions of the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, 18 USCS 921 et seq., including 18 USCS 922(a)(1)(A), which forbids dealing in firearms without a federal license. At an accused's trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for violating 18 USCS 922(a)(1)(A), there was adequate evidence that the accused was dealing in firearms and knew that his conduct was unlawful, but there was no evidence that he was aware of the federal licensing requirement. After the trial judge instructed the jury that ""willfully"" in 924(a)(1)(D) required only the intent to do something unlawful, the accused was convicted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, expressing the view that the jury instructions were proper, affirmed the District Court judgment (122 F3d 90)."
"Some American investment funds purchased unsecured, guaranteed notes from a Mexican holding company. After the holding company encountered financial troubles and missed an interest payment on the notes, the investment funds accelerated the principal amount of the notes and filed suit, on the theory of breach of contract, for damages representing the amount allegedly due, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to the personal jurisdiction of which the holding company had consented. The funds, alleging that the holding company was at risk of insolvency, if not already insolvent, and that the company's planned transfer of certain assets would frustrate any judgment that the funds could obtain against the company, requested, while the breach-of-contract action was pending, requested a preliminary injunction restraining the company from transferring these assets. After issuing a temporary restraining order preventing transfer of the assets, the District Court preliminarily enjoined the company from disposing of the assets. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (143 F3d 688)."
"An action against the Federal Election Commission and various government officials was instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by various individuals and groups, including federal officeholders, candidates, and political organizations, challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (generally 2 USCS 431 et seq., 18 USCS 591 et seq.) and the provisions of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 9001 et seq.) for public financing of Presidential election campaigns. The principal statutes involved--attacked primarily as violating First Amendment speech and association rights and Fifth Amendment equal protection principles--(a) limit political contributions by individuals or groups to any single candidate for a federal elective office to $ 1,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(1)), limit contributions to any such candidate by political committees to $ 5,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(2)), and impose a $ 25,000 annual limitation on total contributions by any contributor (18 USCS 608(b)(3)); (b) limit independent expenditures by an individual or group advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office to $ 1,000 per year (18 USCS 608(e)(1)), set limits, depending on the office involved, on expenditures by a candidate for federal office during any calendar year (18 USCS 608(a)(1)), and establish limits, depending on the office involved, on overall campaign expenditures by candidates (18 USCS 608(c)); (c) require political committees to report to the Federal Election Commission the names of persons contributing more than $ 10, with the names of those contributing more than $ 100 in a calendar year being subject to public inspection (2 USCS 431 et seq.), and require every person or group (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes independent political contributions or expenditures exceeding $ 100 in a calendar year, other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate, to file a statement with the Commission (2 USCS 434(e)); and (d) provide for the public financing from general revenues of Presidential nominating conventions, general election campaigns, and primary campaigns, with the principal portion of public funds being allocated to ""major"" political parties (parties receiving 25% or more of the vote in the most recent Presidential election) and their candidates (26 USCS 9001 et seq.). The plaintiffs also contended that the method of appointment of members of the Federal Election Commission under 2 USCS 437c(a)(1)--which provides that two of the six voting members are to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate, two are to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two are to be appointed by the President, with all six members being subject to confirmation by the majority of both Houses of Congress--violated the principle of separation of powers as contained in the provisions of the appointments clause of the Constitution (Art II, 2, cl 2) requiring that the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint all officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, unless Congress vests the appointment of such officers in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments. Pursuant to 2 USCS 437h, the District Court certified the constitutional questions to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional attacks on the basic statutory provisions involved (171 App DC 172, 519 F2d 821). To avoid any possible questions as to jurisdiction to hear the challenge to the constitutionality of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, a three-judge District Court sat jointly with the Court of Appeals and adopted the Court of Appeals' opinion on such matter (401 F Supp 1235)."
"An accused was (1) convicted in a South Dakota court on charges including first-degree murder, (2) sentenced to death, and (3) unsuccessful both on ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á[***441]‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á direct review and in state habeas corpus proceedings. In 2000, the accused filed a then-timely federal habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. However, after AEDPA's limitations period had run, the District Court held that some of the accused's claims had not been exhausted. The accused therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending federal habeas corpus petition in abeyance, while he presented his unexhausted claims to the South Dakota courts. The District Court (1) granted the motion, and (2) issued a stay conditioned upon the accused's commencing (as he did) state-court exhaustion proceedings."
"A board-certified anesthesiologist who was denied admission to a hospital staff, because the hospital had an exclusive services contract with a firm of anesthesiologists, sued for a declaratory judgment that the contract was unlawful and an injunction ordering the hospital to appoint him to the hospital staff. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana denied relief, finding that the anticompetitive consequences of the contract were minimal and outweighed by benefits in the form of improved patient care (513 F Supp 532). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed on the ground that the contract was illegal per se (686 F2d 286)."
"In defendants' trial, in the Chancery Court of McMinn County, Tennessee, on a charge of criminal contempt committed by violating an injunction issued in connection with a labor dispute and barring the inflicting of harm or damage upon the persons or property of the employees or any other person, defendants' request for trial by jury was denied. Over their timely objection, the court admitted in evidence an air rifle found by police officers in defendants' automobile as a result of a warrantless search--after their arrest for a traffic offense--conducted while defendants were in custody inside the courthouse and their automobile was parked on the street outside. Defendants were found guilty and were given the maximum sentence authorized by statute, 10 days in jail and a $ 50 fine. The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed. (219 Tenn 472, 410 SW2d 881.)"
"Indians who had executed an oil and gas lease approved by the Department of the Interior for use on allotted lands held by the Indians under trust patents issued by the United States pursuant to the General Allotment Act of 1887 instituted an action against the lessee in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, to recover for an alleged breach of the lease by the lessee. The District Court sustained the lessee's demurrer, dismissing the petition, and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed on the ground that the petitioners were precluded from suing by the provisions of the lease and by federal regulations promulgated to control oil and gas leases on restricted Indian land."
"Nonunion employees at a coal mine in Wyoming selected two labor union employees, who were not employees at the mine, to serve as miners' representatives pursuant to a provision of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977 (Mine Act) (30 USCS 813(f)). The operator of the mine did not post information regarding the miners' representatives, as required by an administrative regulation ( 30 CFR 40.4), but complained to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) that the designation compromised the operator's rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 151 et seq.). The MSHA District Manager responded with a letter instructing the operator to post the miners' representative designations. Meanwhile, the operator, before receiving the letter, filed suit against the Secretary of Labor, the MSHA, and others in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, in which suit it was claimed that (1) the designation of nonemployee miners' representatives violated the principles of collective bargaining representation under the NLRA as well as the operator's right to exclude union organizers from company property; and (2) requiring the operator to challenge the MSHA's interpretation of 813(f) and 30 CFR Part 40 through the statutory-review process set forth in 30 USCS 815, 816, and 823--under which process any challenges to the MSHA's enforcement measures are reviewed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission and then by the appropriate United States Court of Appeals--would violate the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The District Court ultimately granted the operator a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of 30 CFR Part 40. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated and remanded, on the ground that the Mine Act precluded District Court jurisdiction over the operator's claims (969 F2d 970)."
"The defendant (unknowingly) infringed plaintiff's copyright. Under the Federal Copyright Act (17 USC 101 (b)) the court has a choice between measuring recovery either by profit to the infringer and damage caused by the infringement or, in lieu of actual damages and profits, granting discretionary damages within the statutory limits. At the trial defendant showed, without contradiction, profits resulting from the infringement, contending that this was the exclusive measure of its liability. The trial court, concluding that the amount of actual damages caused by the infringement was not computable from the evidence, allowed discretionary damages in the maximum statutory amount, which were greatly in excess of defendant's profits."
"Respondent Sheehan lived in a group home for individuals with mental illness. After Sheehan began acting erratically and threatened to kill her social worker, the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) dispatched police officers Reynolds and Holder to help escort Sheehan to a facility for temporary evaluation and treatment. When the officers first entered Sheehan's room, she grabbed a knife and threatened to kill them. They retreated and closed the door. Concerned about what Sheehan might do behind the closed door, and without considering if they could accommodate her disability, the officers reentered her room. Sheehan, knife in hand, again confronted them. After pepper spray proved ineffective, the officers shot Sheehan multiple times. Sheehan later sued petitioner San Francisco for, among other things, violating Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) by arresting her without accommodating her disability. See 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º12132. She also sued petitioners Reynolds and Holder in their personal capacities under 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983, claiming that they violated her Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary judgment because it concluded that officers making an arrest are not required to determine whether their actions would comply with the ADA before protecting themselves and others, and also that Reynolds and Holder did not violate the Constitution. Vacating in part, the Ninth Circuit held that the ADA applied and that a jury must decide whether San Francisco should have accommodated Sheehan. The court also held that Reynolds and Holder are not entitled to qualified immunity because it is clearly established that, absent an objective need for immediate entry, officers cannot forcibly enter the home of an armed, mentally ill person who has been acting irrationally and has threatened anyone who enters."
"An individual was one of two supervising engineers employed by a corporation which operated a fleet of passenger cruise ships. The engineer, while based at the corporation's Miami, Florida office, had employment duties which ran to the entire fleet of vessels and included (1) overseeing the vessels' engineering departments, which required the engineer to take a number of voyages; and (2) planning and directing ship maintenance from the shore. On the day of the engineer's departure from Baltimore, Maryland, aboard one of the corporation's vessels, the engineer developed a problem with his right eye. The ship's doctor diagnosed a suspected detached retina, but the engineer received no further medical care until the vessel arrived in Bermuda 2 days later--notwithstanding that standard medical procedure would have been to direct the engineer to see an ophthalmologist on an emergency basis. Although an operation in Bermuda was a partial success, the engineer lost 75 percent of his vision in his right eye. Following his recuperation, the engineer sailed with the same vessel to Bremerhaven, Germany, where the vessel was placed in drydock for a 6-month refurbishment. The engineer stayed with the vessel while it was in drydock and sailed back to the United States. Some time after his return, the engineer was discharged by the corporation. Thereafter, the engineer filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the corporation. The engineer sought compensatory damages under the Jones Act (46 USCS Appx 688)--which in 46 USCS Appx 688(a) provides a cause of action in negligence for any ""seaman"" injured in the course of employment--for the alleged negligence of the ship's doctor. At trial, the District Court instructed the jury that (1) the engineer had to either have been permanently assigned to the vessel or have performed a substantial part of his work on the vessel; and (2) in determining whether the engineer had performed a substantial part of his work on the vessel, the jury could not consider the period of time the vessel was in drydock in Germany, because the vessel was out of navigation during such time period. The engineer objected to the part of the instructions relating to the drydock period. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the corporation solely on the issue of the engineer's status as a seaman under the Jones Act. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, vacating the District Court's judgment and remanding the case for a new trial, expressed the view that (1) the test for seaman status under the Jones Act--an employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation--was met where (a) a maritime worker contributed to the function of, or helped accomplish the mission of, a vessel, (b) the worker's contribution was limited to a particular vessel or identifiable group of vessels, (c) the worker's contribution was substantial in terms of its duration or nature, and (d) the course of the worker's employment regularly exposed the worker to the hazards of the sea; and (2) the District Court had erred in instructing the jury that it could not consider the time the engineer had spent with the vessel while it was in drydock (20 F3d 45)."
"Negroes who, in separate trials, had been convicted of capital felonies and sentenced to death by North Carolina courts filed applications for habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that their convictions were vitiated by disregard of federal constitutional rights. It was alleged that the selection of jurors on the basis of property tax lists resulted in a discrimination against Negroes, with the result that fewer Negroes than whites, having regard for their proportion of the population, appeared on the panels. In Nos. 20 and 32, it was also alleged that due process was violated by the use of coerced confessions. Finally, in No. 20, the conviction was challenged on the additional ground that the state appellate court, in violation of due process, had refused to hear defendant's appeal on the merits. In two cases (Nos. 22 and 32) the constitutional questions had been already raised and adversely decided by the state trial court; the trial court's action had been affirmed by the highest state court; and the United States Supreme Court had denied certiorari. In the third case (No. 20) the highest court of the state, although having discretion to hear the appeal, dismissed the appeal because the prisoner's attorneys had not served a statement of the case until one day after lapse of the sixty-days' period allowed by the trial court. In that case also certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court."
"The accused was convicted in a Louisiana trial court on two counts of manslaughter and three counts of first-degree murder. An essential element of the latter verdicts was the jury's finding that the accused had intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm on more than one person. Before the jury began its sentencing deliberations, the trial judge instructed them (1) that they should each consider the views of their fellows with the goal of reaching a verdict, but should not surrender their honest beliefs in doing so, and (2) that if they failed to reach a unanimous recommendation, the court would be required to sentence the accused to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, probation, or suspended sentence. When informed the next day that the jury was unable to reach a decision, the judge recalled the jury and asked each juror to write on a slip of paper (1) the juror's name and (2) whether the juror thought that further deliberations would be helpful in obtaining a verdict. Four jurors answered in the negative, and defense counsel unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. On being advised that some jurors had misunderstood the question, the judge again polled the jury and found that only one juror believed that further deliberations would not enable the jury to arrive at a verdict. The judge then repeated the aforementioned instructions, and shortly thereafter the jury recommended a death sentence, which was based in part on the statutorily specified aggravating circumstance that the accused had knowingly created a great risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person. Defense counsel had not objected to the polling or supplemental charge. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed the accused's conviction and sentence; while holding that another aggravating circumstance relied on by the jury had been improperly applied, the court ruled that the aforementioned aggravating circumstance was sufficient to support the death sentence and that the jury had not been improperly coerced into recommending the sentence (495 So 2d 1245). The accused subsequently petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana for a writ of habeas corpus, on the theory, among others, that his death sentence was invalid because (1) the aggravating circumstance relied on was a necessary element of the underlying offense and (2) the judge had coerced a sentencing verdict from the jury. The District Court denied relief, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed (817 F2d 285)."
"Federal agents in Utah, seeking to prevent unlawful grazing on the federal range, proceeded under the Utah abandoned horse statute in impounding horses and burros owned by plaintiffs. The Federal Range Code authorizes federal agents to impound unlawfully grazing livestock after serving written notice upon the owner, in proceedings under local law, but, in the instant case, no notice was given to the plaintiffs."
"The accused was sentenced by a California court in 1980 to a prison term of 15 years to life for the killing of his wife, but became eligible for parole in 1990. After a parole suitability hearing was held in 1989, the California board of prison terms determined that the accused was not suitable for parole for several reasons, including the facts that he had previously been convicted of murder and had killed his wife while on parole from his prior incarceration. Under the law in place at the time of the 1980 killing, the accused would have been entitled to subsequent suitability hearings on an annual basis. However, in 1981, the California Legislature amended the law, authorizing the deferral of subsequent suitability hearings for up to 3 years if a prisoner had been convicted of more than one offense involving the taking of life and if the board (1) found that it was not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following years, and (2) stated the bases for its finding. The board accordingly (1) found that the accused would not reasonably be expected to be granted parole in 1990 or 1991, and (2) scheduled the next hearing for 1992. The accused filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of California, asserting that, as applied to him, the 1981 amendment violated the ex post facto clause of Art I, 10, cl 1 of the Federal Constitution. The District Court denied the habeas corpus petition, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the ex post facto clause was violated (16 F3d 1001)."
