"Section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCS 26) provides that any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to have injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity. After a company which operated supermarkets in many states, including California, notified the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), under 15 USCS 18a, that the company intended to acquire all of a major competitor's outstanding stock, the FTC negotiated a settlement which included a condition that the acquirer comply with a ""Hold Separate Agreement"" preventing the acquirer from integrating the two companies' assets and operations until after the acquirer had divested itself of several designated supermarkets. The state of California then filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleged that the merger violated federal antitrust statutes, including 7 of the Clayton Act (15 USCS 18), which generally prohibits acquisitions whose effect may be substantially to lessen competition. Meanwhile, the company consummated the merger as a matter of legal form under Delaware corporation law, but the two companies' business operations were not combined, as a matter of practical fact, due to the ""Hold Separate Agreement."" The District Court eventually entered a preliminary injunction--which ordered the acquirer, during the pendency of the action, to take all steps necessary to operate the two companies independently in California, and to refrain from taking any action to modify the status quo as to the California operations of the two companies, other than in the ordinary course of business--and expressed the view that (1) the state of California had proved a prima facie violation of 7; (2) the state had made an adequate showing of irreparable harm to Californians; (3) such harm outweighed the harm that the acquirer would suffer as a result of the injunction; and (4) under the circumstances, the injunction was not prohibited by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit precedent to the effect that divestiture was not an authorized form of injunctive relief under 16 (697 F Supp 1125). On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals, ordering that the preliminary injunction be set aside, expressed the view that (1) the District Court had not abused its discretion in finding that the state had proved (a) a likelihood of success on the merits, and (b) the probability of irreparable harm; but (2) divestiture was not an available remedy in private actions under 16; and (3) 16 did not permit indirect divestiture by means of an injunction which, as in the case at hand, (a) did not on its face order divestiture, but (b) had the same effect (872 F2d 837).",Health

"The Medicare program, codified under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 1395 et seq.), allows health care providers to enter into agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to which they are reimbursed for certain costs associated with the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. Under 1395f(b)(1), the Secretary is required to reimburse providers' reasonable cost or customary charges, and under 1395x(v)(1)(A), the Secretary is empowered to issue regulations for setting the methods to be used in computing such costs and to establish, as part of the methods, appropriate cost limits. The Secretary issued regulations imposing limits on the amount of reimbursement based on a range of factors designed to approximate the cost of providing general routine patient service. Although the regulations generally provided that reimbursable costs had to be within the cost limits, the regulations allowed for adjustments, exemptions, and exceptions to the limits under certain circumstances. Under 1395g(a), the Secretary is required to periodically determine the amount which should be paid and to pay providers at least once per month approximate interim payments with necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments, while under 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii), the regulations are required to provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs prove to be either inadequate or excessive. Six hospitals whose costs during several years exceeded the corresponding cost limits filed an appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB), arguing that under 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii), they were entitled to reimbursement of all costs they could show to be reasonable, even if the costs were in excess of the applicable cost limits. After the PRRB granted the hospitals' request for expedited judicial review, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska held that 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) compelled the Secretary to reimburse to the hospitals all costs shown to be reasonable, regardless of whether the costs surpassed the amounts calculated under the cost limit schedule. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, holding that 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) permitted only a year-end book balancing of the monthly installments paid to the providers with the amount determined to be reasonable under the applicable regulations, reversed the District Court judgment (952 F2d 1017).",Health
"An individual, conceding that he was a ""public figure"" for purposes of the First and Fourteenth Amendment rule precluding recovery in a defamation action absent proof by ""public figure"" plaintiff that an alleged damaging falsehood has been published with ""actual malice,"" brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with regard to a television program that had been broadcast and a related article that had been published in a magazine. In preparation for proving his case in light of the constitutional requirements, the plaintiff deposed the individual defendant who had produced and edited the television program and who had later published the magazine article, but such defendant refused to answer a variety of questions on the ground that the First Amendment protected against inquiry into the editorial process and the state of mind of those who edit, produce, or publish. Rejecting a claim of constitutional privilege under the First Amendment which would increase the weight of a defamation plaintiff's burden of proof, the District Court applied the standard of Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permitting the discovery of any matter ""relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action,"" and ruled that because the defendant's state of mind was of central importance to the issue of malice in the case, the questions asked by the plaintiff were relevant to the plaintiff's efforts to discover whether the defendant had any reason to doubt the veracity of certain of his sources or to prefer the veracity of one source over another (73 FRD 387). On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that under the First Amendment there was an absolute privilege as to editorial processes which protected the defendant from inquiry about his thoughts, opinions, and conclusions with respect to the material gathered by him and about his conversations with his editorial colleagues (568 F2d 974).",Civil Rights
"An accused was charged in a three-count indictment in Federal District Court with assault, illegal use of a firearm, and attempt to kill a deputy United States marshal. At a plea hearing, the Federal Government presented as fact that (1) ""contemporaneous with"" the kicking open of the accused's apartment door by United States marshals, who had a warrant for the accused's arrest on an unrelated charge, the accused fired a gunshot ""through the door opening,"" which gunshot ""lodged in the front door just above the doorknob,"" after which the door slammed shut and the marshals withdrew; and (2) when the door was kicked open again moments later, the accused fired another gunshot, which also lodged in the door. The accused, agreeing that ""what the Government say[s] that it could prove [happened] happened,"" pleaded guilty to the assault and firearm counts, and not guilty to the attempted murder count. The accused's attorney stated that the accused was ""not admitting he attempted to specifically murder anyone."" Two months later, the accused was sentenced. Pursuant to 1B1.2(a) of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (18 USCS Appx), it is provided--as an exception to the general rule that a court pronouncing sentence under the Guidelines must apply the base offense level most applicable to the offense of conviction--that, in the case of conviction by a plea of guilty ""containing a stipulation"" that ""specifically establishes"" a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the court shall apply the sentencing guideline most applicable to the stipulated offense. The District Court, relying upon 1B1.2(a), found that the facts as acknowledged by the accused at the plea hearing ""added up"" to the offense of attempted murder--which offense had a higher base offense level than did aggravated assault--and sentenced the accused accordingly. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court's use of a base offense level for attempted murder pursuant to 1 B1.2 (903 F2d 292).",Law and Crime

"Upon learning that the Republic of Nigeria was interested in contracting for a construction project on an air force base in Nigeria, the chief executive officer (CEO) of a New Jersey corporation made arrangements for a Nigerian citizen to endeavor to secure the contract for the corporation. It was agreed that if the corporation secured the contract, the corporation would funnel a percentage of the contract price as a bribe to officials of the Nigerian government though the payment of a ""commission"" to Panamanian entities which the Nigerian citizen controlled. Both the payment and the receipt of bribes in connection with the award of a government contract were prohibited by Nigerian law. The corporation was awarded the contract, and the bribes were paid. A Pennsylvania corporation, which had been an unsuccessful bidder for the contract, learned of the ""commission"" and brought the matter to the attention of American and Nigerian officials. The New Jersey corporation and its CEO were eventually charged with violations of a federal corrupt practices statute, and both pleaded guilty. The Pennsylvania corporation subsequently brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the New Jersey corporation, its CEO, the Nigerian citizen, and others, in which action the Pennsylvania corporation sought damages under various federal and state statutes. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the action was barred by the act of state doctrine. In response to the District Court's request, the United States Department of State submitted to the court a letter in which the State Department's legal advisor addressed the question of the applicability of the act of state doctrine to the Pennsylvania corporation's action. The District Court, treating the defendants' motion to dismiss the action as a motion for summary judgment and granting the motion, concluded that the act of state doctrine was applicable if the inquiry presented for judicial determination included the motivation of a sovereign act which would result in embarrassment to the sovereign or constitute interference in the conduct of foreign policy of the United States (659 F Supp 1381). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, reversing, ruled that the defendants had not met their burden of showing that the case should not go forward, in light of the view expressed by the State Department in its letter to the District Court that the interests of the executive branch of the Federal Government would not be harmed by prosecution of the action (847 F2d 1052).",Civil Rights

"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Attorney General of Rhode Island, and a privately-owned public utility which generated and transmitted electricity at wholesale from several hydroelectric plants within New Hampshire and which was licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to the Federal Power Act (16 USCS 792 et seq.) appealed to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire an order of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission requiring the utility to arrange to sell within New Hampshire hydroelectric energy which it had previously exported to, among other places, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

"An Arkansas city, in an application to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), sought a permit for the city's new sewage treatment plant under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The EPA, pursuant to 402(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 USCS 1342(a)(1)), issued a permit which (1) authorized the plant to discharge up to half of its effluent into a stream whose waters ultimately entered a river which flowed into Oklahoma, but (2) imposed various conditions, including a provision that the permit would be modified if a pending study determined that more stringent limitations were necessary to insure compliance with Oklahoma's water quality standards. Oklahoma authorities, challenging the permit before the EPA, alleged that the plant's discharge violated Oklahoma standards prohibiting any degradation of water quality in the river in question. An administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the issuance of the permit on the ground that the discharge would not have an ""undue impact"" on Oklahoma waters; but the EPA's Chief Judicial Officer (CJO), remanding for application of a different standard of review, interpreted Oklahoma's ban on degradation of the river in question as allowing the permit to be upheld if the record showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the authorized discharges would not cause an actual detectable violation of Oklahoma water quality standards. On remand, the ALJ made detailed factual findings and determined that the CJO's standard had been met. The CJO sustained the issuance of the permit. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, on judicial review, reversed the issuance of the permit, as the court (1) interpreted the Act as providing that a proposed source may not be permitted where it would discharge effluent that would contribute to conditions currently constituting a violation of applicable water quality standards, (2) found that the river in question was already degraded in water quality and that effluent from the sewage treatment plant could be expected to contribute to the river's ongoing deterioration even though it would not detectably affect water quality, and (3) determined that the EPA's decision was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA had misinterpreted Oklahoma water quality standards and failed to consider the important and relevant fact of the river's degraded status (908 F2d 595).",Civil Rights
"These cases raised the issue of whether contractual liens arising from certain federal loan programs took precedence over private liens in the absence of a federal statute setting priorities. Resolution of this question required a decision as to whether federal or state law governed the controversies, and, if federal law applied, whether a uniform priority rule should be fashioned, or whether state commercial law should be incorporated as the appropriate federal rule. One case (No. 77-1359) involved two contractual security interests in the same personal property which were perfected under a state's Uniform Commercial Code. The United States' lien secured a loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, while the private liens, which arose from security agreements preceding the federal guarantee, secured certain advances made by a private corporation after the federal guarantee. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, on determining that federal law controlled, applied the ""first-in-time"" and choateness doctrines, and held that the government's lien was superior to the private lien (401 F Supp 316). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, while agreeing that federal law governs, reversed, refusing to extend the choateness rule to situations in which the government was a voluntary lender (557 F2d 491). The Court of Appeals held that the private lien was superior by fashioning a new federal rule whereby the first lien perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code achieved priority. Although not adopting state law, the Court of Appeals also determined that such law would grant priority to the private corporation's security interests. In the second case (No. 77-1644), the Farmers Home Administration, to secure certain loans, received a security interest in crops and farm equipment, and perfected that interest by filing a standard FHA financing statement with state officials. Subsequently, a private individual repaired the borrower's tractor on several occasions, and acquired a lien under state law by retaining the tractor after the borrower failed to pay repair bills. The government sought to obtain possession of the tractor after the borrower filed for bankruptcy. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia held that the government agency had not properly perfected its security interest due to an inadequate description of collateral, and that, even if the description were sufficient, both federal and state law accorded priority to the private individual's lien. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, ruling that federal law controlled the rights and liabilities of the parties, and that the description of collateral was sufficient to perfect the FHA's interest under a federal rule derived from the Model Uniform Commercial Code (563 F2d 678). The court then devised a ""federal commercial law rule"" giving priority to repairman's liens over the government's previously perfected consensual security interests when the repairman continuously possessed the property from the time his lien arose, with the result that only the private individual's lien for his final repair bill took precedence over the FHA's security interest.",Civil Rights

Following a plan devised by its general counsel to minimize its liability under 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act for short-swing profits by holders of more than 10 percent of a corporation's stock, Y made two sales of X's stock within 6 months of the purchase, the first sale at $ 68 per share reducing its holdings to 9.96 percent, and the second sale disposing of the remainder at $ 69 per share.

"The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved a portion of Georgia's implementation plan for achieving the federal ambient air quality standards under the 1970 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (PL 91-604, 84 Stat 1676), which establishes a program for controlling air pollution. Georgia's plan, in addition to providing for immediately effective categorical emission limitations, also incorporated a variance procedure whereby particular sources could obtain individually tailored relief from general requirements. The Agency's approval of Georgia's variance provisions was based on its interpretation of 110(a)(3) of the Act (42 USCS 1857c-5(a)(3)), which provides that the Agency shall approve any revision of a state's implementation plan which meets the requirements applicable to an original plan set forth in 110(a)(2) of the Act. On petition for review by two non-profit corporations concerned with environmental protection and two individual citizens, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered the Agency to disapprove Georgia's variance provisions (489 F2d 390). The Court of Appeals held that while the revision authority of 110(a)(3) of the Act was available for generally applicable changes of an implementation plan, the provision of 110(f), dealing with postponement of a state's compliance with any requirement of an applicable implementation plan, was the only method by which individual sources could obtain relief from applicable emission limitations.",Civil Rights

"A provision of the zoning code of a city in the state of Washington, in governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defined ""family"" as (1) an individual or two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage; or (2) a group of five or fewer persons not so related. After a group home for 10 to 12 unrelated adults recovering from alcoholism or drug addiction began operation in a leased dwelling within a single-family residential zone in the city, the city issued criminal citations to the owner and one resident for allegedly violating the zoning restriction. The corporation that operated the home requested that the home be allowed to remain in the leased dwelling as a ""reasonable accommodation"" pursuant to a provision of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) (42 USCS 3604(f)(3)(B)), which made it illegal to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations might be necessary to afford persons with handicaps equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The city declined the corporation's request and instead passed an ordinance listing group homes as permitted uses in multifamily and general commercial zones. The city, seeking a declaration that the zoning restriction did not violate the FHA, filed suit against the corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The corporation, counterclaiming under the FHA, alleged that the city had failed to make a reasonable accommodation. The United States filed a separate action on the same reasonable accommodation ground, and the two cases were consolidated. The District Court, in granting summary judgment to the city, ruled that the zoning restriction was exempt from the FHA's requirements under an FHA provision (42 USCS 3607(b)(1)) exempting reasonable local, state, or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in reversing and remanding on appeal, said that 3607(b)(1) exempted only occupancy restrictions that applied to all occupants, regardless of whether such occupants were related to each other (18 F3d 802, 4 ADD 1004).",Civil Rights

Noting that a proper motion under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254(a) requires more than merely being ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ somewhere, the court reasoned that ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´the proper procedure for Wright to challenge his current federal custody would be a motion filed in the Eastern District of Tennessee pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2255.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. The Court of Appeals reversed. In its view, Wright‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s state conviction was ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§a necessary predicate‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ to his federal conviction, 819 Fed. Appx. 544, 545 (CA9 2020) (quoting Zichko v. Idaho, 247 F. 3d 1015, 1019 (CA9 2001)), so Wright was in fact in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. The panel declined to assess the District Court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s view that ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2255, rather than ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254, provided the proper route for Wright to challenge his current custody. 819 Fed. Appx., at 546, n. 1. One judge concurred and asserted that ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254 was the proper mechanism ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´because Wright is not attacking the constitutionality of his federal conviction for failing to register as a sex offender in Tennessee; he is collaterally attacking the constitutionality of his predicate Alaska conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Id., at 546. The Court of Appeals clearly erred. Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ In Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989) (per curiam), we held that a habeas petitioner does not remain ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ under a conviction ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´after the sentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because of the possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent crimes of which he is convicted.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Id., at 492; see also id., at 490 (noting the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ requirement appears in both ¬¨¬®‚àö√º¬¨¬®‚àö√º2241(c)(3) and 2254(a)). It made no difference, we said, that the possibility of a prior-conviction enhancement had materialized for the habeas petitioner in that case: ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´When the second sentence is imposed, it is pursuant to the second conviction that the petitioner is incarcerated and is therefore ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§in custody.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Id., at 492‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®493. That Wright‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s state conviction served as a predicate for his federal conviction thus did not render him ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254(a). If Wright‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s second conviction had been for a state crime, he independently could have satisfied ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254(a)‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´in custody‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ requirement, see Lackawanna County District Attorney v. Coss, 532 U. S. 394, 401‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®402 (2001), though his ability to attack the first conviction by that means would have been limited, see id., at 402‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®404. Wright could not satisfy ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2254(a) on that independent basis for the simple reason that his second judgment was entered by a federal court",Law and Crime
"The defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana by a Michigan Circuit Court after the court denied the defendant's motion to suppress marijuana seized from his car. Two officers had stopped to investigate after the defendant swerved his car into a ditch. The officers observed a knife on the floorboard of the driver's side of the car and subjected the defendant to a frisk. An officer shined his flashlight into the interior of the vehicle to search for other weapons and noticed that something was protruding from under the armrest on the front seat. After lifting the armrest, the officer saw an open pouch on the front seat containing marijuana. The defendant was then arrested, and the officers found more marijuana in the trunk. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant's conviction (94 Mich App 338, 288 NW2d 629). The Michigan Supreme Court reversed, holding the search invalid (413 Mich 461, 320 NW2d 866).",Law and Crime
"The state of Washington imposed a tax upon a foreign corporation's privilege of engaging in business activities within the state, the tax being measured by the corporation's gross wholesale sales of motor vehicles, parts, and accessories delivered in the state. Against various attacks made by the corporation upon the validity of the tax, the Washington Superior Court held that the presence of a branch office in the state rendered some of the transactions of one of the Washington divisions of the corporation subject to tax, but, as to the remainder, held that the application of the tax statute would be repugnant to the commerce and due process clauses of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Washington reversed the latter finding, holding that all of the appellant's transactions were subject to the tax, on the ground that the tax bore a reasonable relation to the corporation's activities within the state. (60 Wash 2d 862, 376 P2d 843.) Upon appeal, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. In an opinion by Clark, J., expressing the views of five members of the Court, it was held that the tax was constitutionally valid, since it was levied on the incidents of a substantial local business of the corporation.",Domestic Commerce
"An individual and her company (1) brought an FTCA action against the United States in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York; and (2) alleged negligence by some federal customs agents in executing a search. However, on a motion by the Federal Government, the District Court dismissed this action, on the asserted basis of an exception (in 28 U.S.C.S. _ 2680) to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity (in 28 U.S.C.S. _ 1346) ( 253 F. Supp. 2d 361). Meanwhile, the individual had also (1) filed, in the District Court, a Bivens action (under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971) 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.

After the FTCA action's dismissal, the District Court, in response to a defense motion, refused to apply the _ 2676 judgment bar to the Bivens action, as the court expressed the view that the FTCA action's dismissal had been solely on a procedural ground ( 281 F.

"An indictment against the defendants was filed on August 12, 1966, for crimes relating to allegedly false income tax returns. The returns in question were filed on August 12 and 15, 1960, pursuant to an extension of time obtained by the defendants from the original due date of May 15, 1960. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana dismissed two counts charging an attempt to evade taxes by filing a false return and aiding in the preparation and presentation of a false return, on the ground that the 6-year statute of limitations (26 USC 6531) barred prosecution under such counts.

"Petitioners produced equipment for three Navy ships. The equipment required asbestos insulation or asbestos parts to function as intended, but the manufacturers did not always incorporate the asbestos into their products. Instead, the manufacturers delivered much of the equipment to the Navy without asbestos, and the Navy later added the asbestos to the equipment. Two Navy veterans, Kenneth McAfee and John DeVries, were exposed to asbestos on the ships and developed cancer. They and their wives sued the manufacturers, alleging that the asbestos exposure caused the cancer and contending that the manufacturers were negligent in failing to warn about the dangers of asbestos in the integrated products. Raising the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´bare-metal defense,‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ the manufacturers argued that they should not be liable for harms caused by later-added third-party parts.

"In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º111 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º7411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to issuing a final rule by May 2012. The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated efforts to regulate greenhouse gases. Two groups of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners here. One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts. According to the complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the Nation. By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs asserted, the defendants‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law. All plaintiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually. The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticiable political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed. On the threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing. On the merits, the court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´federal common law of nuisance,‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ relying on this Court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v.
