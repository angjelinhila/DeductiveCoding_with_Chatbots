"A cruise ship which was owned by an Italian company was hijacked by terrorists in the Mediterranean Sea. During the hijacking, several American passengers sustained injuries, and one American passenger was killed. Actions were later filed by such passengers or their personal representatives in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the company, to recover damages for the wrongful death of the slain passenger and for the injuries sustained by the other passengers. The company moved to dismiss the actions, on the ground that a forum-selection clause printed on each passenger ticket obligated passengers to institute any suit arising in connection with the contract in Naples, Italy, and to renounce the right to sue elsewhere. The District Court denied the company's dismissal motions, holding that the tickets did not give the passengers reasonable notice that they were waiving their opportunity to sue the company in a domestic forum over a contract made and delivered in the United States. The company appealed, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal (844 F2d 50), holding that the District Court's interlocutory order denying the company's motions to dismiss was not immediately appealable under 28 USCS 1291, since such order did not fall within the exception for collateral final orders established by Cohen v Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.

"Respondent, an American soldier, while guarding a machine gun and clothing left in an Army exercise area in Japan, fatally wounded a Japanese woman who was gathering expended cartridge cases in the area. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State determined that respondent should, as requested by Japanese authorities, be delivered for trial on criminal charges in the Japanese courts. These American authorities acted pursuant to an Administrative Agreement, authorized by the Security Treaty between Japan and the United States, which, although providing that the United States should have primary jurisdiction over members of the Armed Forces in relation to offenses arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty, also provides that a state having primary jurisdiction in any particular case may decide not to exercise jurisdiction, and that the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right where such other state considers the waiver to be of particular importance. Seeking to avoid trial in the Japanese courts, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The writ was denied, but respondent was granted declaratory relief and an injunction against his delivery to the Japanese authorities (____ F Supp ____).",Law and Crime

"The water district was a governmental joint venture which supplied water from the river to one county in each State, the power company operated dams on the river to generate electricity under a federal license, and the municipality drew water from the river under a permit from North Carolina. The Court held that the water district and the power company demonstrated sufficiently compelling interests that were unlike the interests of other citizens of the States to warrant intervention, but the municipality failed to make such a showing. The water district was an unusual bi-state entity which was jointly owned and regulated by the counties, and protecting the viability of its operations was premised on a fine balance between two participating counties which would likely be upset without representation of its interests in the litigation. Further, it was likely that any equitable apportionment of the river would need to take into account the amount of water that the power company needed to sustain its operations and obtain a license renewal. However, the municipality was part of a class of North Carolina users and North Carolina could adequately protect the municipality's interests.",Environment
"A man who lost an eye while working as a lasher aboard a vessel in New York waters brought an action for damages against the shipowner in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County, alleging negligence and unseaworthiness. After the court denied leave to amend the complaint so as to add the man's wife as a plaintiff for loss of society, the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, reversed, and granted the motion to amend (59 App Div 2d 883, 399 NYS2d 673). The Court of Appeals of New York, on certification, affirmed, ruling that the wife of an injured worker may seek recovery, under general maritime law, for loss of consortium occasioned by her husband's injury (46 NY2d 634, 389 NE2d 461, 415 NYS2d 979).",Law and Crime
"A New York resident brought a libel suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, against an Ohio corporation that publishes a magazine, alleging diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. The plaintiff's only connection with New Hampshire was the circulation there of a magazine that she assisted in producing, and the corporation's contacts with New Hampshire consisted of monthly sales of approximately 15,000 copies of its nationally published magazine. The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbade application of New Hampshire's long-arm statute in order to acquire personal jurisdiction over the corporation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, holding that the plaintiff's lack of contacts with New Hampshire rendered the state's interest in redressing the libel too attenuated for an assertion of personal jurisdiction over the corporation, and concluding that it would be unfair to assert jurisdiction over the corporation in view of the single publication rule, which would require an award of damages caused in all states, and in view of New Hampshire's unusually long period of limitations for libel actions (682 F2d 33).",Law and Crime
"To protect its jeopardy income tax assessments against a Uruguayan corporation, the government obtained, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a temporary injunction against a national bank located in New York City, with a branch office in Uruguay, enjoining the bank from transferring any property or rights to property of the taxpayer held by the bank or by any of its branch offices within or without the United States, the District Court indicating that it would modify the order should compliance be shown to violate the law of Uruguay.

At the time of the issuance of the injunction the taxpayer was beyond the reach of the District Court insofar as personal service was concerned, but a subsequently enacted New York statute made out-of-state service possible.

"Under 33 USCS 702c, which was originally enacted as part of the Flood Control Act of 1928, the United States is immune from liability for ""any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place."" In United States v James (1986) 478 US 597, 92 L Ed 2d 483, 106 S Ct 3116, the United States Supreme Court (1) ruled that the Federal Government was immune, under 702c, from liability with respect to some unwarned releases of reservoir waters after the Army Corps of Engineers had determined that the waters were at a flood stage; and (2) in so ruling, commented that the 702c terms ""floods"" and ""flood waters"" apply to all waters contained in or carried through a federal flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control, as well as to waters that such projects cannot control. A canal in California (1) was a federal facility, (2) was leased to a local irrigation district, and (3) flowed through an owner's pistachio orchards. The owner (1) brought a Federal District Court action against defendants including the United States; (2) included allegations that the defendants' negligence in the canal's design, construction, and maintenance had caused subsurface flooding that had supposedly resulted in damage to the orchards and increased operating costs for the owner; and (3) sought relief including money damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 USCS 2671 et seq.). However, on the basis of 702c, the District Court granted a motion by the United States for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint with respect to the United States. Even though the District Court accepted the owner's submission that the canal was used for irrigation purposes, the court reasoned that (1) the parties agreed that the canal was part of a particular federal project, and (2) this project had flood control as one of its purposes. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that even though the water in the canal was not held for the purpose of flood control, 702c immunity attached because the canal was (1) part of the federal project, and (2) accordingly, ""not wholly unrelated"" to flood control (177 F3d 834).",Law and Crime

"After a doctor had performed surgery at a Louisiana hospital to implant a ""plate and screw device"" in the lower spine of a patient who was a Mississippi resident, and after the device's screws had broken off inside the patient's back, the patient (1) filed a diversity suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Pennsylvania corporation which had manufactured the device, for allegedly defective design and manufacture; (2) at the same time, filed a state administrative proceeding against the doctor and the hospital for alleged malpractice and negligence; and (3) at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, filed suit against the doctor and the hospital in Louisiana state court. The corporation moved to dismiss the federal suit for failure to join necessary parties pursuant to Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the District Court, citing the interest of judicial economy, ordered the patient to join the doctor and the hospital or risk dismissal. When the patient failed to join the doctor and the hospital, the District Court dismissed the suit with prejudice. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that (1) it was prejudicial to have the separate litigations being carried on, where the claims overlapped; and (2) therefore, the District Court had not abused its discretion in ordering joinder (898 F2d 152).

"North Carolina's Agricultural Extension Service, a division of the school of agriculture at North Carolina State University, maintains programs to educate farmers, to establish 4-H and Homemaker (home economics) Clubs, and to develop community resources. These programs are implemented in the state's 100 counties by local agents who are hired jointly by the Extension Service and the respective Boards of County Commissioners. The Extension Service and the county boards also jointly determine all workers' salaries, which are contributed to by the federal, state, and county governments. Extension Service activities are coordinated in each county by a chairman who is responsible both to the Service and to the county board. Prior to August 1, 1965, the Extension Service was divided into a ""white branch"" and a ""Negro branch,"" which were subsequently merged into a single organization. However, some disparities remained between the salaries of white and black personnel, and although the 4-H and Homemaker Clubs were opened to any eligible person regardless of race, many of the clubs continued to be all white or all black. In 1971, Extension Service employees, recipients of its services, Homemaker Club members, and parents of 4-H Club youths brought an action in United States District Court, in which the United States later intervened, against the president of the University of North Carolina system, other school officials, and county commissioners from three counties, alleging racial discrimination in the Extension Service's employment and provision of services. The District Court declined requests to certify four classes of plaintiffs and one class of defendants, and held that the Extension Service had conducted itself in a nondiscriminatory manner since it became subject, as a public employer, to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) in 1972 and since the merger of the black and white branches in 1965.

"Under a West Virginia program that allowed foreign medical school graduates to practice under a temporary permit while studying for the state licensing exams, some physicians were allowed to practice for years, even though they repeatedly failed the state exams. After several temporarily licensed physicians formed an organization to represent their interests, a West Virginia state legislator, who was a leading supporter of the program, (1) sponsored a bill extending the program for another year; (2) after discussing with an organization lobbyist possible legislation that would grant temporarily licensed foreign physicians a permanent medical license by virtue of their years of experience, agreed to sponsor such legislation; and (3) during a 1984 re-election campaign, informed the lobbyist that (a) the campaign was expensive and involved considerable expenditures of the legislator's own funds, and (b) the legislator had not heard anything from the foreign physicians. The legislator thereafter received from some of the foreign physicians cash which the legislator neither listed as campaign contributions nor reported as income on his 1984 federal income tax return. Although the physicians' organization kept detailed books of its expenditures, the cash payments, rather than being listed as campaign contributions, had entries accompanied only by initials or other codes signifying that the payments were to the legislator. Two weeks after the permanent-license legislation was enacted, the legislator received more cash from the foreign physicians. The legislator was indicted for (1) violating the Hobbs Act (18 USCS 1951), which prohibits extortion--the consensual obtaining of property from another by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right--by allegedly extorting payments under color of official right; and (2) filing a false income tax return in violation of 26 USCS 7206(1), by allegedly failing to report as income the cash that was received from the foreign physicians. The jury was instructed that (1) extortion does not occur when a public official receives a legitimate gift or voluntary political contribution, (2) a voluntary payment is one that is freely given without expectation of benefit, and (3) a voluntary political contribution is not taxable income, provided that the contribution is used for campaign expenses. The legislator was convicted under the Hobbs Act with respect to one physician's payment and was convicted under 7206(1). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in affirming the convictions, (1) expressed the view that elected public officials could be convicted under the Hobbs Act without proof of a quid pro quo--a promise of official action or inaction in exchange for any payment or property received--for receiving money other than legitimate campaign contributions; (2) listed seven factors to be considered in determining whether the parties ever intended the payments to be legitimate campaign contributions; (3) found that the parties never so intended; and (4) ruled that the fact that the jury had convicted the legislator of violating the Hobbs Act under such facts implicitly indicated that the jury had rejected the legislator's attempt to characterize the payment as a campaign contribution (896 F2d 61).",Law and Crime

"After they had published articles identifying by name a 14-year-old youth who had been arrested for allegedly killing another youth, two newspapers which had learned the juvenile's identity through the use of routine reporting techniques--the monitoring of the police band radio frequency and the questioning of witnesses, the police, and an assistant prosecuting attorney at the scene of the killing--were indicted by a state grand jury in West Virginia for having violated a West Virginia law making it a crime for a newspaper to publish, without the written approval of a juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender. The newspapers filed an original jurisdiction petition with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, seeking a writ of prohibition against the prosecuting attorney and the judges of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, to prevent such officials from prosecuting the newspapers. In support of their petition, the newspapers alleged that their indictment had been based on a statute violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Holding that the state statute operated as a prior restraint on speech and that the state's interest in protecting the identity of juvenile offenders did not overcome the heavy presumption against the constitutionality of such a prior restraint, the Supreme Court of Appeals issued the writ of prohibition (____ W Va ____, 248 SE2d 269).",Law and Crime
"A provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS _ 1226(c)) directed the Attorney General to take into custody any alien who was removable from the United States as having been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes, including an ""aggravated felony.""

The alien, although arguably conceding that he was deportable--and without seeking an administrative hearing at which he would have been entitled to attempt to demonstrate that he was not properly included in a mandatory-detention category--filed a federal habeas corpus action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In this action, the alien argued that his detention under _ 1226(c) violated the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, as the INS had made no determination that he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk. The District Court (1) concluded that _ 1226(c)'s requirement of mandatory detention for certain criminal aliens violated due process; and (2) granted the alien's habeas corpus petition, subject to the INS' prompt undertaking of an individualized bond hearing to determine whether the  [***725]  alien posed either a flight risk or a danger to the community ( 1999 US Dist LEXIS 12511).

The employee brought an action against the union and the plan's trustees, alleging, among other things, that they had misrepresented and omitted to state material facts with respect to the value of a covered employee's interest in the pension plan, so as to constitute violations of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USCS 78j(b)) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 USCS 77q(a)). Denying a motion to dismiss these allegations on the ground that the employee had no cause of action under either Act, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held that the employee's interest in the pension fund constituted a ""security"" within the meaning of 2(1) of the Securities Act (15 USCS 77b(1)) and 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act (15 USCS 78c(a)(10)), and that there had been a ""sale"" of the interest to the employee within the meaning of 2(3) of the Securities Act (15 USCS 77b(3)) and 3(a)(14) of the Securities Exchange Act (15 USCS 78c(a)(14)) (410 F Supp 541).

"An Ohio corporation doing business in West Virginia took the position that West Virginia's gross receipts tax on persons engaged in the business of selling tangible property at wholesale could not be imposed on the sales which the Ohio corporation made through franchisees and nonresident salesmen, and that because local manufacturers were exempt from the tax, the tax discriminated against interstate commerce. After a hearing, West Virginia's Tax Commissioner determined that the tax was properly assessed on the sales at issue, and that the Ohio corporation had not shown that the tax was discriminatory. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County West Virginia reversed, holding that the nexus between the sales and the state of West Virginia was insufficient to support imposition of the tax. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court and upheld the tax, holding both that the taxpayer had a substantial nexus with West Virginia justifying the total tax and that the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce because while local manufacturers making sales in West Virginia were exempt from the gross receipts tax, they paid a much higher manufacturing tax (303 SE2d 706).",Domestic Commerce

The United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) began to develop a plan for a project to allocate water among competing uses and competing users, including the Klamath Tribe and several other Indian tribes, in an area that included parts of Oregon and California. After the Department asked the tribes to consult with Reclamation concerning the water allocation plan, the parties created a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the tribes that called for assessment, in consultation with the tribes, of the impacts of the plan on tribal trust resources. At approximately the same time, the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the tribes in an Oregon state-court adjudication intended to allocate water rights. The Bureau--which did not act as counsel for the Klamath Tribe, which had its own lawyers and independently submitted claims on its own behalf--consulted with the Klamath Tribe, and the two parties exchanged memorandums on the appropriate scope of the claims submitted by the United States for the benefit of the Klamath Tribe. An association of water users whose interests, because of the scarcity of water in the area, were adverse to tribal interests, (1) sued the Bureau in a Federal District Court under FOIA, and (2) sought to compel release of certain documents communicated between the Bureau and the Klamath Tribe with respect to the federal and state proceedings. The District Court ruled that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.
