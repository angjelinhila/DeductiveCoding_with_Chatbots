"A marine fuels supplier and a corporation which engaged in maritime commerce negotiated a requirements contract. Under the terms of the contract, (1) the supplier would supply the corporation's vessels with marine fuels, at the corporation's request, when the vessels called at ports where the supplier could supply the fuels directly; and (2) in ports where the contracting supplier had to rely on local suppliers, the contracting supplier would pay the local supplier for the fuel and then invoice the corporation. Subsequently, pursuant to the contract, the supplier procured fuel at a port in Saudi Arabia for a vessel chartered by the corporation, paid for the fuel, and invoiced the corporation. Shortly thereafter, the corporation filed for reorganization in bankruptcy and never paid the full amount for the fuel. Subsequently, the supplier--claiming to have a maritime lien on the vessel, under a federal statute, both for the fuel delivery in Saudi Arabia and for a separate unpaid bill for fuel that the supplier had supplied directly to the corporation in New York--brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the vessel's owner in personam and the vessel in rem. The District Court (1) denied the supplier's lien claim with respect to the Saudi Arabia delivery for lack of admiralty jurisdiction, on the ground that agency contracts were excluded per se from federal admiralty jurisdiction; but (2) granted the supplier's lien claim with respect to the New York delivery (707 F Supp 155). The District Court denied the supplier's motion for reconsideration (717 F Supp 1029), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (904 F2d 33).",Transportation

"Under 18 USCS 3731, the Federal Government may appeal a Federal District Court order suppressing evidence which the government proposes to use in a pending criminal case, provided that the appeal (1) is taken within 30 days after the decision has been rendered, and (2) is diligently prosecuted. Also, Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that when an appeal by the government is authorized by statute, the notice of appeal shall be filed in the District Court within 30 days after the entry of the order appealed from. In a federal narcotics trial in which the Federal Government proposed to use certain evidence obtained as a result of a search, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming--noting that the government had abandoned a ""continuing consent"" theory to justify the search--rejected other arguments and granted the accused's motion to suppress the evidence (725 F Supp 1195). The government filed with the District Court a motion for reconsideration on the sole basis of a reassertion of the continuing consent theory, but the District Court denied the motion (731 F Supp 1037). The government then noticed an appeal 76 days after the initial suppression order, but less than 30 days after the denial of the motion for reconsideration. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, dismissing the appeal as untimely, expressed the view that, because the motion had sought reconsideration of a previously disavowed theory, the motion did not ""toll"" the 30-day period to appeal which began to run on the date of the initial order (920 F2d 702).",Law and Crime

"A valid copyright registration provides a copyright holder with important legal advantages, including the right to bring a ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´civil action for infringement‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ of the copyrighted work. 17 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º411(a). Petitioner Unicolors, the owner of copyrights in various fabric designs, filed a copyright infringement action against H&M Hennes & Mauritz (H&M). A jury found in favor of Unicolors. H&M sought judgment as a matter of law, arguing that Unicolors could not maintain an infringement suit because Unicolors knowingly included inaccurate information on its registration application, rendering its copyright registration invalid. The alleged inaccuracy stemmed from Unicolors having filed a single application seeking registration for 31 separate works despite a Copyright Office regulation that provides that a single application may cover multiple works only if they were ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´included in the same unit of publication.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ H&M argued that Unicolors did not meet this requirement because Unicolors had initially made some of the 31 designs available for sale exclusively to certain customers, while offering the rest to the general public. The District Court determined that because Unicolors did not know when it filed its application that it had failed to satisfy the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´single unit of publication‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ requirement, Unicolors‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• copyright registration remained valid by operation of the safe harbor provision provided under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º411(b)(1)(A). On appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that it did not matter whether Unicolors was aware that it had failed to satisfy the single unit of publication requirement, because the safe harbor excuses only good-faith mistakes of fact, not law. Unicolors had known the relevant facts, so its knowledge of the law (or lack thereof ) was irrelevant.",Law and Crime
"The holders of a company's convertible debentures who failed to answer the company's call for redemption of their debentures within the time limit set by the company brought a class action against the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the company had violated federal and state laws by failing to give reasonably adequate notice of the redemption. Ultimately, the District Court entered judgment against the company and in favor of the plaintiff class of all holders of convertible debentures who failed to exercise their conversion rights within the time limit set by the company, such judgment establishing the amount of the company's liability to the class as a whole, fixing the amount each member of the class could recover, and providing that each individual recovery was to carry its proportionate share of the total amount allowed for attorney's fees, expenses, and disbursements. The company thereafter appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as to that portion of the judgment relating to attorney's fees, asserting that such fees should be awarded only from the portion of the fund actually claimed by class members, and not from the portion of the judgment fund which was not claimed by absentee class members, but the Court of Appeals affirmed (590 F2d 433).",Domestic Commerce

"A state prisoner filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Under that court's Local Rule 16, as amended pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Act (28 USCS 631 et seq.), the District Court assigned the case to a full-time magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing and denied the prisoner's motion to reassign the hearing to a district judge; the motion was based on the ground that the Act did not authorize district courts to assign to magistrates the duty to hold habeas corpus evidentiary hearings. Thereafter the magistrate proceeded with the hearing, electronically recorded all testimony evidence as required by the Local Rule, and transmitted the recording of the testimony to the District Court, with recommendations that the petition be dismissed. On the prisoner's motion for a de novo hearing, the district judge merely listened to the recording of the hearing before the magistrate, and on this basis and the basis of the magistrate's recommendations, dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the judgment of dismissal and remanded the case with instructions that the District Court itself hold an evidentiary hearing on the prisoner's constitutional claims (483 F2d 1131).",Law and Crime
"Anti-trust litigation instituted by the government against appellant and appellees in 1940 resulted in a decree of a three-judge court of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, entered May 15, 1951, to the effect that the multiple uniform price-fixing patent license agreements between appellant and appellees were illegal per se. Appellees did not pay royalties under these license agreements from February 1, 1948, to May 15, 1951 (when new license agreements containing no price-fixing clauses were made). Appellant brought suits against appellees in a federal court in Iowa, alleging three separate grounds for recovery: (1) the royalty provisions of the old license agreements (counts I and II); (2) quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the use of the patents (counts III and IV); and (3) damages for patent infringement (count V). Thereafter the appellees, claiming that the institution of the Iowa actions violated the 1951 decree, and that in any event appellant was barred from recovery by reason of unpurged misuse of the patents involved, petitioned the anti-trust court to enjoin appellant from further prosecuting the Iowa suits. The anti-trust court decided that it had jurisdiction to grant relief, and, without taking any evidence beyond that already of record in the anti-trust proceeding, modified the 1951 decree so as to enjoin the prosecution of the Iowa suits (124 F Supp 573, motion for new trial denied 134 F Supp 69). The court held that prosecution of counts I and II could not be maintained under the terms of the 1951 decree; although finding that counts III-V were not barred by that decree, it further held that the suits should be prohibited in their entirety because of appellant's unpurged misuse of its patents. The anti-trust court then entered a decree modifying the 1951 decree by ordering appellant to dismiss the Iowa suits with prejudice. The present appeal was taken from the last modifying decree.",Domestic Commerce
"A local telephone company that had been buying obsolete telephone equipment removal services from a particular supplier switched its purchases of such services to a more expensive competitor of the supplier. The supplier then brought against the company an action alleging that the company's decision, not justifiable in terms of ordinary competitive objectives, to switch to the competitor were unfair, improper, and anticompetitive. After a Federal District Court dismissed the supplier's complaint for failure to state a claim, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming the dismissal with an exception (93 F3d 1055), determined that (1) the supplier had alleged a cause of action under the rule of reason and may have alleged a cause of action under the rule, set forth in Klor's, Inc. v Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc. (1959) 359 US 207, 3 L Ed 2d 741, 79 S Ct 705, that group boycotts are per se violations of 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1), and (2) the supplier's complaint stated a valid claim of conspiracy to monopolize under the Act's 2 (15 USCS 2).",Domestic Commerce

"Under various provisions of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) (5 USCS 7101 et seq.), (1) federal agencies and the unions that represent the agencies' employees are required to meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement (5 USCS 7114(a)(4)), (2) ""collective bargaining agreement"" is defined as an agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining (5 USCS 7103(a)(8)), and (3) ""collective bargaining"" is defined as involving the meeting of employer and employee representatives at reasonable times to consult and to bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment, incorporating any collective bargaining agreement reached as a result of these negotiations in a written document (5 USCS 7103(a)(12)). A union representing employees of a subagency of the United States Department of the Interior proposed including in the parties' basic labor contract a provision that would have obligated the Department, at the union's request, to negotiate midterm--that is, while the basic contract was in effect--on any negotiable matters not covered by the provisions of this basic contract. The Department, contending that the FSLMRS prohibited such a provision, refused to accept or bargain about the proposed clause. The FLRA, asserting that the FSLMRS had to be read to require midterm bargaining, (1) expressed the view that the Department's refusal to bargain amounted to an unfair labor practice under the FSLMRS, and (2) ordered the Department to bargain over the proposed clause. The Department petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for review of the order, while the FLRA, joined by the union as intervenor, cross-petitioned for enforcement of the order. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in granting review and denying enforcement, concluded that (1) the FSLMRS did not impose any midterm bargaining duty, and (2) the parties therefore ought not to be required to bargain endterm--that is, during the negotiations over adopting or renewing the basic contract--about including a clause that would require bargaining midterm (132 F3d 157, 1997 US App LEXIS 30039).",Labor

"The Georgia legislature authorized a Georgia county, whose single commissioner performed all legislative and executive functions of the county government, to adopt a multimember commission consisting of five members elected from single-member districts and a chairperson elected at large. After county voters, who previously had approved a five-member district for election of the county school board, failed to adopt the change to a multimember commission, the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and six black registered voters from the county, nearly 20 percent of whose eligible voting population was black, filed against the county commissioner and the superintendent of elections a suit alleging that the single-member commission (1) was enacted or maintained with an intent to exclude or limit the political influence of the county's black community in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and (2) violated _ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended (42 U.S.CS 1973), which provides that no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in the denial or abridgments of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.

"Respondents, employees of petitioner Tyson Foods, work in the kill, cut, and retrim departments of a pork processing plant in Iowa. Respondents' work requires them to wear protective gear, but the exact composition of the gear depends on the tasks a worker performs on a given day. Petitioner compensated some, but not all, employees for this donning and doffing, and did not record the time each employee spent on those activities. Respondents ified suit, alleging that the donning and doffing were integral and indispensable to their hazardous work and that petitioner's policy not to pay for those activities denied them overtime compensation required by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 &FLSA). Respondents also raised a claim under an Iowa wage law. They sought certification of their state claims as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and certification of their FLSA claims as a ""collective action."" See 29 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º216. Petitioner objected to certification of both classes, arguing that, because of the variance in protective gear each employee wore, the employees' claims were not sufficiently similar to be resolved on a classwide basis. The District Court concluded that common questions, such as whether donning and doffing protective gear was compensable under the FLSA, were susceptible to classwide resolution even if not all of the workers wore the same gear. To recover for a violation of the FLSA's overtime provision, the employees had to show that they each worked more than 40 hours a week, inclusive of the time spent donning and doffing. Because petitioner failed to keep records of this time, the employees primarily relied on a study performed by an industrial relations expert, Dr. Kenneth Mericle. Meridle conducted videotaped observations analyzing how long various donning and doffing activities took, and then averaged the time taken to produce an estimate of 18 minutes a day for the cut and retrim departments and 21.25 minutes for the kill department. These estimates were then added to the timesheets of each employee to ascertain which class members worked more than 40 hours a week and the value of classwide recovery. Petitioner argued that the varying amounts of time it took employees to don and doff different protective gear made reliance on Mericle's sample improper, and that its use would lead to recovery for individuals who, in fact, had not worked the requisite 40 hours. The jury awarded the class about $2.9 million in unpaid wages. The award has not yet been disbursed to individual employees. The Eighth Circuit armed the judgment and the award.",Labor
"The former stockholders of a company, who had agreed to merge that company into another company and to exchange their stock in the first company for stock in the second company, subsequently concluded that financial statements of the second company on which they had allegedly relied had misrepresented that company's financial condition. The stockholders accordingly filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which action alleged that the second company, the accounting firm which had prepared the financial statements, and certain individuals had committed violations of the federal securities laws and Georgia common law. On January 30, 1985, the jury found in favor of the accounting firm and a director of the second firm, but returned a verdict against the other defendants and awarded the stockholders more than $ 2 million in damages; the stockholders immediately made an oral motion for prejudgment interest on that award, but were told to submit their motion in writing within 10 days; and the judgment was filed and entered. On February 11, 1985, the stockholders filed a motion for prejudgment interest; on March 1, 1985, the stockholders filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in favor of the accounting firm and the director; on July 1, 1985, the District Court, ruling on the motion for prejudgment interest, entered an order stating that the judgment would be amended to reflect the addition of prejudgment interest; on July 9, 1985, the District Court filed an amended judgment adding prejudgment interest to the judgment; and on July 31, 1985, the stockholders filed a new notice of appeal which failed to include the accounting firm as a party. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the stockholders' appeal as to the accounting firm for lack of jurisdiction, on the grounds that (1) the motion for prejudgment interest constituted a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (2) all notices of appeal filed prior to the disposition of that motion were therefore ineffective under Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; and (3) no ""unique circumstances"" sufficient to validate a premature appeal were shown by the stockholder's alleged reliance on (a) orders of the District Court which appeared to treat the judgment of January 30 as final and appealable, (b) the District Court clerk's requirement of a filing fee for the July 31 notice which should not have been necessary if a Rule 59 motion had been made, or (c) the Court of Appeals' failure to originally notify the stockholders that jurisdiction was questionable (825 F2d 1521).",Domestic Commerce
"In order to carry out its program for the maintenance of minimum retail prices, the defendant, a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, discussed this program with retailers who sold below such minimum prices and told them that if they continued to do so it would refuse to deal with them. The defendant also informed wholesalers in the area that it would refuse to deal with them if they sold defendant's products to offending retailers. Similar tactics were followed to induce retailers not to advertise defendant's products at prices below its minimum retail prices. This program was carried out until the Department of Justice started an investigation under the Sherman Antitrust Act. In the present action the government sought an injunction under the Sherman Act against the defendant, alleging that defendant conspired and combined, in violation of 1 and 3 of the act, with retail and wholesale druggists in Washington, D. C., and Richmond, Virginia, to maintain the wholesale and retail prices of its products. The violation was alleged to have occurred during the summer of 1956 when there was no Fair Trade Law in the District of Columbia or State of Virginia. At the close of the government's evidence, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the government's proofs did not establish a violation of the act, because defendant's actions were merely a refusal to have business relations with retailers who disregarded its price policy, and hence were sanctioned under the doctrine laid down in United States v Colgate Co. 250 US 300, 63 L ed 992, 39 S Ct 465, 7 ALR 443.

"A municipal official testified before a state grand jury in New Jersey after prosecutors and the official's attorneys agreed that if the official testified neither his statements nor any evidence derived from them could, under a New Jersey immunity statute, be used in subsequent state criminal proceedings, with the exception of prosecutions for perjury or false swearing. When an agreement could not be worked out to avoid the official's criminal prosecution, he was indicted for misconduct in office and extortion by a public official. After completion of the state's case in the official's state criminal trial, defense counsel requested a ruling by the trial judge as to the use of the official's previous grand jury testimony. The trial judge ruled that if the official testified and gave an answer on direct or cross-examination which was materially inconsistent with his grand jury testimony, the prosecution could use that testimony in cross-examining the official. Because of the ruling the official did not testify, and he was ultimately found guilty. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that use of the immunized grand jury testimony to impeach the official would have violated the United States Constitution (151 NJ Super 200, 376 A2d 950). Afterwards, the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the state's petition for certification of an appeal (75 NJ 597, 384 A2d 827).",Law and Crime
"The United States Tax Court held that the employment of construction workers at a site different from their permanent residence, for continuous periods of 20 1/2 months, 12 1/2 months, and 8 1/2 months, respectively, was ""temporary,"" so as to entitle them, under 23(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, to deduct from their gross income, for purposes of federal income tax, amounts expended for living expenses at the site of their employment and for transportation from that site to their permanent residence upon leaving that employment. (27 TC 149.) The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed (254 F2d 483), finding that the employment was ""indefinite"" and not ""temporary.""",Labor
"An Ohio corporation doing business in West Virginia took the position that West Virginia's gross receipts tax on persons engaged in the business of selling tangible property at wholesale could not be imposed on the sales which the Ohio corporation made through franchisees and nonresident salesmen, and that because local manufacturers were exempt from the tax, the tax discriminated against interstate commerce. After a hearing, West Virginia's Tax Commissioner determined that the tax was properly assessed on the sales at issue, and that the Ohio corporation had not shown that the tax was discriminatory. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County West Virginia reversed, holding that the nexus between the sales and the state of West Virginia was insufficient to support imposition of the tax. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court and upheld the tax, holding both that the taxpayer had a substantial nexus with West Virginia justifying the total tax and that the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce because while local manufacturers making sales in West Virginia were exempt from the gross receipts tax, they paid a much higher manufacturing tax (303 SE2d 706).",Domestic Commerce
"In an action brought by the plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for a judgment declaring him to be a citizen of the United States, the issue was whether the plaintiff, a native- born American who also had Japanese nationality under Japanese law, had lost his American citizenship under 401(c) of the Nationality Act of 1940 by entering the Armed Forces of Japan. The plaintiff alone testified at the trial, stating that he was inducted into the Japanese Armed Forces pursuant to the compulsory conscription law of that country, that rumors of harsh punishment of draft evaders by the secret police and the ruthlessness of the government in power made him afraid to take any action to avoid service, and that he did not seek aid of American officials. The District Court, not believing the testimony of the plaintiff, rendered judgment against him, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed that judgment (235 F2d 135).",Immigration
"In settlement of a lawsuit brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a leather-goods manufacturer against alleged trademark infringers who manufactured and distributed imitations of its goods, the alleged trademark infringers agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from further activity which would infringe the trademark of the leather-goods manufacturer. After submission of an affidavit by counsel for the leather-goods manufacturer, the District Court (1) found probable cause to believe that the trademark infringers had engaged in conduct in violation of the injunction, and (2) appointed counsel for the leather-goods manufacturer as special counsel to represent the United States in an investigation and possible prosecution of a criminal contempt action. Subsequently, the District Court signed an order directing the alleged trademark infringers to show cause why they should not be cited for contempt for violating the permanent injunction. The alleged trademark infringers filed, but were denied, motions opposing the order to show cause and the appointment of an interested party's counsel as special prosecutors (592 F Supp 734). The alleged trademark infringers were convicted of criminal contempt or of aiding and abetting the criminal contempt. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1) rejected the contention that the appointment of the leather-goods manufacturer's counsel as special prosecutors violated the alleged trademark infringers' right to be prosecuted by an impartial prosecutor, (2) suggested that an interested party's attorney would often be the only source of information about contempts occurring outside the court's presence, (3) stated that the supervision of contempt prosecutions by a judge would generally be sufficient to prevent the danger that a special prosecutor would use the threat of prosecution as a bargaining chip in civil negotiations, (4) stated that the authority to prosecute encompasses the authority to engage in necessary investigative activity, and (5) affirmed the alleged trademark infringers' convictions (780 F2d 179).",Law and Crime
"Registration and barratry statutes enacted by the Virginia legislature as part of its general plan of massive resistance to the integration of schools of the state were challenged by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia as invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.

"In Wilko v Swan (1953) 346 US 427, 98 L Ed 168, 74 S Ct 182, the United States Supreme Court held that a predispute agreement to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""1933 Act"") (15 USCS 77a et seq.) was unenforceable, under 14 of the 1933 Act (15 USCS 77n), which nullifies any binding stipulation ""to waive compliance with any provision"" of the 1933 Act. Subsequently, however, in Shearson/American Express, Inc. v McMahon (1987) 482 US 220, 96 L Ed 2d 185, 107 S Ct 2332, the Supreme Court held that a similar antiwaiver provision in 29(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""the 1934 Act"") (15 USCS 78cc(a)) did not prevent the enforcement of predispute agreements to arbitrate claims under the 1934 Act. Several securities investors who were customers of a broker signed a standard agreement which included a clause requiring the arbitration of any controversies relating to their accounts. When the investments turned sour, the investors sued the broker and the broker's principal in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and included claims under 12(2) of the 1933 Act (15 USCS 77l(2)) and several provisions of the 1934 Act. After the principal moved that the claims be submitted to arbitration, under the agreement and under 2 of the Arbitration Act (9 USCS 2)--which generally declares as a matter of federal law that arbitration agreements shall be enforceable--the District Court ordered that (1) all claims except the 12(2) claims were to be submitted to arbitration, but (2) the 12(2) claims, under the rule of Wilko v Swan, had to proceed to court action. On reconsideration, the District Court reaffirmed its ruling. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversing, held that the arbitration agreement was enforceable as to the 12(2) claims, because Supreme Court decisions subsequent to Wilko v Swan had reduced Wilko v Swan to ""obsolescence"" (845 F2d 1296). The Court of Appeals then denied rehearing en banc (850 F2d 1582).",Law and Crime
"Even after ""dual"" public school systems--that is, systems which were racially segregated by law--had been held to violate the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, Mississippi's dual public university system, composed of five historically white and three historically black institutions, remained largely segregated. In 1963, the state's three ""flagship"" historically white universities enacted a policy requiring all entrants to achieve a minimum score of 15 on a particular college admissions test, at a time when the average score was 18 for whites and 7 for blacks. In 1975, private plaintiffs filed a suit--in which the United States intervened as plaintiff--in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and alleged that state officials had failed to satisfy their obligations, under provisions including the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000d), to dismantle Mississippi's dual system of higher education. The parties attempted to achieve a consensual resolution through voluntary dismantlement. In 1981, the state assigned its universities three categories of missions: (1) ""comprehensive""--the three flagship universities--with the greatest resources and program offerings; (2) ""urban""--the sole urban university, historically black--with a more limited mission geared toward the urban setting; and (3) ""regional""--the remaining four universities, two historically white and two historically black--with primarily an undergraduate role. By the mid-1980's, the student bodies of the state's universities were still predominantly white or black according to whether the universities were historically white or black, but the District Court ruled that the case ought to be dismissed, as the court expressed the view that (1) in the higher education context, the state's affirmative duty to desegregate did not contemplate either the restriction of choice or the achievement of any degree of racial balance; (2) while student enrollment and faculty and staff hiring patterns had to be examined, greater emphasis ought to be placed on current state higher education policies and practices in order to insure that they (a) were racially neutral, (b) had been developed and implemented in good faith, and (c) did not substantially contribute to the continued racial identifiability of the individual institutions; and (3) the current actions of Mississippi officials demonstrated that they were fulfilling their duty (674 F Supp 1523). On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered a reversal and remand, on the ground that Mississippi had not complied with its duty to eliminate all of the vestiges of segregation, root and branch, in the public university system (893 F2d 732). On rehearing en banc, however, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision and expressed the view that Mississippi had discharged its duty to dismantle its dual system of higher education, because the record made it clear that (1) the state had adopted and implemented race-neutral policies for operating its universities, and (2) all students had real freedom of choice to attend the university that the students wished (914 F2d 676).",Civil Rights
