"The United States brought an action against two members of the Shoshone Tribe for grazing livestock without a permit. The United States District Court for the District of Nevada ruled that the tribe's aboriginal title to the land had been extinguished when an earlier monetary award by the Indian Claims Commission was certified for payment, at which time the amount of the award was automatically appropriated and deposited for the tribe in a trust account in the United States Treasury. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that payment had not occurred within the meaning of 22 of the Indian Claims Commission Act (25 USCS 70u(a) (1976 version)), providing that payment of a claim is a full discharge of the United States of all claims and demands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy, since a plan for distribution of the fund to the tribe had not been adopted by Congress (706 F2d 919).",Public Lands

"The present cases involved the construction of the provision of 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1948 which, as a prerequisite of exempting a conscientious objector from military service, requires his belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation. In No. 50 defendant's claim to exemption as conscientious objector was denied after he, professing religious belief and faith and not disavowing, although not clearly demonstrating, any belief in a relation to a Supreme Being, stated that ""the cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence"" and decried the tremendous ""spiritual"" price man must pay for his willingness to destroy human life. He was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of New York of having refused to submit to induction in the Armed Forces. His conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. (326 F2d 846.) In No. 51 the registrant stated that he believed in a ""Supreme Being"" who was ""Creator of Man"" in the sense of being ""ultimately responsible for the existence of"" man and who was ""the Supreme Reality"" of which ""the existence of man is the result."" He was convicted in the same District Court of the same offense, and his conviction was also reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. (325 F2d 409.)

"When the defense in a burglary prosecution in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas, called its only witness, the trial judge, in the jury's absence and on his own initiative, admonished the witness, who was serving a prison sentence, that he was not required to testify, that if he lied under oath, the court would personally see that his case went to the grand jury, that he could be convicted for perjury, and that if he lied on the stand, he would probably have to serve more time and it would be held against him when he was considered for parole. After the defendant's objection to such admonition was rejected, the defense witness refused to testify, and the defendant was ultimately convicted. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, which rejected the defendant's contention that the trial judge's remarks had deprived him of due process by driving his sole witness from the stand (480 SW2d 398).",Law and Crime

"In the Circuit Court for Prince William County, Virginia, a trial jury found a defendant guilty of capital murder. A 2-day penalty phase followed, during which the prosecution sought to prove two aggravating circumstances and the defense presented witnesses in mitigation. The trial judge gave the jury a three-paragraph instruction on fixing the penalty, which instruction was a state pattern instruction that was subsequently upheld by the United States Supreme Court in another case, Buchanan v Angelone (1998) 522 US 269, 139 L Ed 2d 702, 118 S Ct 757, as constitutionally sufficient to allow a capital jury to consider mitigating evidence. The first paragraph provided that before the penalty could be fixed at death, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of two alternative aggravating circumstances. The second paragraph provided that if the jury were to find from the evidence that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt either of the two alternatives, then the jury would be permitted to fix the punishment of the defendant at death, ""or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment"" or imprisonment for life and a fine. The third paragraph provided that if the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the alternatives, then the jury had to fix the punishment at life imprisonment or imprisonment for life and a fine. In addition, (1) the judge gave a specific instruction that the jury would have to consider a mitigating circumstance if the jury found that there was evidence to support that circumstance, and (2) defense counsel specifically explained to the jury during closing argument that the jury could find both aggravating factors proven and still not sentence the defendant to death. During deliberations, the jury sent the trial judge a note asking whether, if the jury believed the accused guilty of at least one of the aggravating circumstances, it was the jury's duty to (1) issue the death penalty, or (2) decide whether to issue the death penalty or a life sentence. The judge responded by directing the jury to the instruction's second paragraph. After 2 more hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict stating that the jury, having unanimously found that the defendant's conduct had satisfied one of the aggravating circumstances--and having considered the evidence in mitigation--unanimously fixed the punishment at death. The jurors were polled and all responded affirmatively that the foregoing was their verdict. In a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia, the defendant presented 47 assignments of error, including as number 44 an assignment of error respecting the judge's answer to the jury's question about mitigating circumstances. However, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the defendant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal (248 Va 460, 450 SE2d 379, cert den 516 US 829, 133 L Ed 2d 55, 116 S Ct 100) and subsequently dismissed the defendant's state habeas corpus petition. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in denying the defendant federal habeas corpus relief, (1) noted that the defendant had alleged, among other matters, that his federal constitutional rights were violated when the trial court refused to give a proposed alternative jury instruction; and (2) concluded that although the proposed instruction was a clearer statement of the law than the instruction actually given, the latter instruction was constitutionally sufficient (4 F Supp 2d 497). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed the defendant's habeas corpus petition (176 F3d 249).",Macroeconomics
"The respondent was hired in 1968 for his first teaching job as an assistant professor at a state university for a fixed term of one academic year. The notice of his faculty appointment so specified. He completed the academic year, but was informed that he would not be rehired for the next academic year. Under university rules, the respondent was given no reason for the decision not to rehire him, nor was he given any opportunity to challenge the decision at any sort of hearing, because (1) he had acquired no tenure rights to continued employment under state statutory law, such rights inuring to the benefit of state university teachers only after 4 years of year-to-year employment, and (2) absent tenure rights, he was entitled to nothing under state law beyond his one-year appointment. The respondent then brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the decision not to rehire him was an attempt to punish him for certain statements he had made that were critical of the university administration in violation of his right to freedom of speech, and that the failure to give him notice of the reason for his nonretention and an opportunity for a hearing was in violation of his right to procedural due process. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the respondent on the due process issue only, ordering the university to grant him a hearing and to provide reasons for his nonretention (310 F Supp 972).

"At an accused's arraignment, in an Idaho state court, on two counts of first-degree murder, the trial judge advised the accused that the maximum punishment that the accused could receive if convicted on either charge was life imprisonment or death. Between the time the accused was convicted on both counts and the time of the accused's sentencing hearing, the state, pursuant to a court order requiring the state to notify the court and the accused whether the state would ask for the death penalty, formally indicated that the state would not recommend the death penalty for either conviction. At the sentencing hearing, (1) the prosecutor (a) explained why the prosecutor had not recommended the death penalty, and (b) recommended an indeterminate life sentence; (2) defense counsel urged the court to impose concurrent, rather than consecutive, indeterminate life sentences; and (3) there was no discussion of the death penalty as a possible sentence. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial judge indicated that the seriousness of the accused's crimes warranted more severe punishment than that which the state had recommended, and that the death penalty was a sentencing option. Subsequently, the judge sentenced the accused to death. Denying the accused's request for postconviction relief that was based on the contention that the trial court had violated the Federal Constitution by failing to give notice of its intention to impose the death sentence in spite of the state's notice that the state was not seeking the death penalty, the trial court held that the Idaho Code provided the accused with sufficient notice of a possible death sentence, and that the prosecutor's statement that the prosecutor did not intend to seek the death penalty had no bearing on the adequacy of notice to the accused that the death penalty might be imposed. The Idaho Supreme Court, concluding that the express advice given to the accused at the accused's arraignment, together with the terms of the Idaho Code, were sufficient notice concerning the death penalty, affirmed the accused's conviction and sentence and also affirmed the denial of postconviction relief (113 Idaho 688, 747 P2d 710). After the United States Supreme Court, on certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court and remanded the case for further consideration, the Idaho Supreme Court reinstated its earlier judgment (116 Idaho 279, 775 P2d 593).",Law and Crime

"A portion of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) (28 USCS 1346(b)) provides that Federal District Courts ""shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States"" for certain torts of federal employees acting within the scope of their employment. When an airplane struck some electric transmission lines during the plane's approach to a San Diego, California airfield, the plane crashed, resulting in the death of a woman's husband and two of her children. The woman initially brought a state-court tort action against (1) a utility company, for alleged negligence with respect to the transmission lines, and (2) the city of San Diego, for alleged negligence with respect to the runway lights. Subsequently, she filed suit against the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, under the FTCA, for the Federal Aviation Administration's alleged negligence with respect to the runway lights and air traffic control. Almost a year later, the woman moved to amend the federal complaint to include claims against the original state-court defendants, as to which no independent base for federal jurisdiction existed. The District Court granted the motion, under a theory of ""pendent jurisdiction"" over the proposed additional defendants.

"This case, a companion case to Lockett v Ohio (1978) 438 US 586, 57 L Ed 2d 973, 98 S Ct 2954, 9 Ohio Ops 3d 26, also presented the question of the constitutionality of the imposition of the death penalty under the Ohio statute requiring a death sentence for a conviction of aggravated murder with at least one of seven aggravating circumstances, unless the sentencer (the trial judge in a jury case, or the three-judge panel which tries the case when a jury is waived) determines that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that (1) the victim induced or facilitated the offense, (2) it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation, or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency (not amounting to insanity). Upon trial before a three-judge panel in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio (the defendant having waived his right to a jury trial), the defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder and of the specification that the murder occurred in the course of a kidnapping, there being some evidence indicating that the defendant acted merely as an aider and abettor of the actual killer. After considering a presentence report and a psychiatric report which concluded that none of the three statutory mitigating factors was present, and after considering evidence and arguments of both sides--the defendant, who was 16 years old at the time of the killing, having testified that he had been under the influence of drugs virtually every day for three years prior to his arrest and on the night of the killing, that he had viewed the person who allegedly actually killed the victim as a ""big brother,"" and that he had followed such person's instructions because he had been ""scared""--the three-judge panel concluded that none of the statutory mitigating circumstances had been established, and sentenced the defendant to death.

Among the practices challenged were (1) the facility's ""double-bunking"" of inmates--assigning inmates to rooms originally intended for single occupancy in which the single bunks were replaced by double bunks, (2) a prohibition against inmates receiving hardcover books unless they were mailed directly from publishers, book clubs, or bookstores, (3) a rule prohibiting inmates from receiving packages from outside the facility containing items of food or personal property, except for one package of food at Christmas, (4) searches of the inmates' rooms during which inmates were not allowed to be present, and (5) strip searches of inmates conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution, including exposure of the inmates' body cavities for visual inspection. On partial summary judgment motions, the District Court enjoined, on various constitutional grounds, the double-bunking practice and the enforcement of the ""publisher-only"" rule (428 F Supp 333), and, after a trial, enjoined the other conditions and practices (439 F Supp 114).

"Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses.

But he rejected the offer, allegedly after his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below the waist. At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and received a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence. In a subsequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondent's claim that his attorney's advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assistance. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the ineffective-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial. Respondent renewed his claim in federal habeas. Finding that the state appellate court had unreasonably applied the constitutional effectiveassistance standards laid out in Strickland v.

"Following the 1990 census, the North Carolina state legislature enacted a reapportionment plan for the state's seats in the United States House of Representatives, which plan created one irregularly-shaped, majority-black congressional district in the northeastern part of the state. The Attorney General of the United States, to whom the plan was submitted for preclearance under 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973c), objected to the plan on the ground that the legislature (1) could have created a second district with a majority of minority-group voters in the southeastern part of the state, with lines no more irregular than those of other districts in the plan, but (2) had declined to do so for pretextual reasons. The state legislature then enacted a revised plan creating a second majority-black district in the north central part of the state, which district followed, and in some places was no wider than, an interstate highway. Individuals who resided and were registered to vote in a certain county, part of which lay in the new district, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against various federal and state officials, which action alleged that the revised reapportionment plan created a racial gerrymander in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. In dismissing the voters' complaint with respect to the state officials, a three-judge panel of the District Court held that the voters had failed to state a claim for relief under the equal protection clause, even if the two districts deliberately had been designed in such a way as to assure black voter majorities, because (1) a 1977 United States Supreme Court decision foreclosed any argument that race-conscious redistricting was unconstitutional as such, at least where, as in the case at hand, a state legislature's racially conscious purpose was to meet the broad remedial requirements of the Voting Rights Act; and (2) the reapportionment plan in question did not have the purpose or effect of depriving white voters of an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice, since the plan did not lead to proportional underrepresentation of white voters statewide (808 F Supp 461).",Civil Rights
"The government of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, permitted the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic organization, to display a creche--a representation of the nativity of Jesus--on the grand staircase inside the main part of the county courthouse in Pittsburgh during the Christmas season each year. During the 1986-1987 season, the creche was on display from November 26 to January 9. The creche display included an angel bearing a banner that proclaimed, ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo!"" (""Glory to God in the Highest!""). The display bore a plaque that said, ""This Display Donated by the Holy Name Society."" The creche stood alone as the single element of the display and was surrounded by a floral decoration. Although Santa Claus figures and other Christmas decorations were present elsewhere in the courthouse, there were no such decorations on the staircase. A nearby ""gallery forum"" area, used for art and other cultural exhibits, was not connected with the creche display. Decorations similar to those in the display were placed next to official county signs on each side of the staircase. The creche was the setting for a program of Christmas carols and other songs from December 3 to December 23, 1986, such program occupying at most 2 hours a day. The county issued press releases identifying the choral program as county sponsored and linking the program to the creche. Another display, outside an office building jointly owned by the city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, consisted of (1) a 45-foot Christmas tree, (2) an 18-foot menorah, a candelabrum associated with the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, and (3) a sign bearing a message that the city salutes liberty during the holiday season. The tree was erected on November 17, 1986; the sign was placed at its foot a few days later, and the menorah was erected next to the tree on December 22, 1986. All were removed on January 13, 1987. The menorah was owned by a Jewish religious organization, but it was stored, erected, and removed by the city. A civil liberties organization and several local residents filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the county from displaying the creche and the city from displaying the menorah on the ground that such displays violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court, holding that the creche and menorah displays did not violate the establishment of religion clause, denied injunctive relief.

"To satisfy customer needs, the competitor modified its design for an adjustable pedal system for vehicles with cable-actuated throttles by adding a modular sensor to make the system compatible with vehicles using computer-controlled throttles. The licensees contended that the competitor infringed the patent claim of a position-adjustable pedal assembly with an electronic pedal position sensor attached a fixed pivot point. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the patent claim was invalid as obvious since mounting an available sensor on a fixed pivot point of the competitor's pedal was a design step well within the grasp of a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art, and the benefit of doing so was obvious. The marketplace created a strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior art taught a number of methods for doing so. Further, the problem to be solved by the patent claim did not limit its application as prior art, the competitor's showing that it was obvious to try a combination of elements sufficiently supported the finding of obviousness, and the claim was the result of ordinary skill and common sense rather than innovation.",Technology

In their final form, these regulations included provisions which (1) required federally assisted hospitals to post notices stating that 504 prohibits the withholding of nourishment and medically beneficial treatment from infants solely on the basis of their handicap; (2) required designated state agencies to establish procedures insuring that they use their full authority to prevent such neglect, including requirements that hospitals report such cases to the agencies; (3) allowed expedited access to patient records, with or without parental consent; and (4) allowed expedited action to enforce 504 and protect such infants.

The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the medical organizations (585 F Supp 541), stating that the case was controlled by a previous decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case involving a seriously deformed newborn infant whose parents had refused to consent to surgical procedures necessary to prolong the infant's life, wherein it was held that 504 did not authorize HHS to obtain pertinent hospital records because that statute was not intended to apply to treatment decisions involving defective newborn infants (729 F2d 144). The Court of Appeals, in accordance with its previous decision, summarily affirmed the District Court's judgment.",Macroeconomics

"Upon trial in an Ohio state court in Wickliffe, Ohio, where the defendant was arrested nine days after he had stolen an automobile, the defendant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of joyriding--taking or operating a car without the owner's consent--the joyriding charge having been based on the defendant's driving of the auto on the last day of his nine-day joyride. Thereafter, the defendant pleaded guilty in a state court in Cuyahoga County to a felony auto theft charge based on his original taking of the auto, the trial court rejecting the defendant's double jeopardy objections. The Court of Appeals of Ohio affirmed, holding that while joyriding was a lesser included offense of auto theft since every element of the crime of joyriding was also an element of the crime of auto theft (the latter having the additional element of intent to permanently deprive the vehicle owner of possession), nevertheless the two prosecutions were based on two separate acts and thus the double jeopardy clause did not bar the second prosecution. The Supreme Court of Ohio denied leave to appeal.",Law and Crime
