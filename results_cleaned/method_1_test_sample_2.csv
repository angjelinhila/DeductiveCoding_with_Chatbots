"In each of these cases, an employer allegedly fired a long-time employee simply for being homosexual or transgender. Clayton County, Geor- gia, fired Gerald Bostock for conduct ‚Äö√Ñ√∫unbecoming‚Äö√Ñ√π a county employee shortly after he began participating in a gay recreational softball league. Altitude Express fired Donald Zarda days after he mentioned being gay. And R. G. & G. R. Harris Funeral Homes fired Aimee Ste- phens, who presented as a male when she was hired, after she in- formed her employer that she planned to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫live and work full-time as a woman.‚Äö√Ñ√π Each employee sued, alleging sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Eleventh Circuit held that Title VII does not prohibit employers from firing employees for being gay and so Mr. Bostock‚Äö√Ñ√¥s suit could be dismissed as a matter of law. The Second and Sixth Circuits, however, allowed the claims of Mr. Zarda and Ms. Stephens, respectively, to proceed.
Held: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII. Pp. 4‚Äö√Ñ√¨33.",Civil Rights,Civil Rights,"The text was classified as 'Civil Rights' because it discusses issues regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, specifically in the context of employment law. It talks about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a key U.S. legislation that prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. The text explains specific cases where employees sue their employers for allegedly firing them due to their homosexuality or transgender identity. Therefore, this text is involved with legal and social matters related to civil rights."
Illinois held to have violated Federal Constitution's First Amendment by completely prohibiting lawyer from advertising his certification as trial specialist by private professional organization.,Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified as 'Law and Crime' because it speaks about a legal issue in the field of constitutional law, specifically related to the First Amendment, and a lawyer (an actor in the legal field). The case revolves around the violation of constitutional rights, an issue that falls under the legal domain."
"The New Mexico Bureau of Revenue imposed a compensating use tax on the Mescalero Apache Tribe based upon the purchase price of materials used to construct 2 ski lifts on a ski resort operated by the tribe on land leased by it from the United States Forest Service, and also imposed an emergency school tax on the ski resort's gross receipts. The tribe appealed to the Court of Appeals of New Mexico, which affirmed (83 NM 158, 489 P2d 666). The Supreme Court of New Mexico denied certiorari (83 NM 151, 489 P2d 659).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified under 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal dispute involving taxation laws, the New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, and the Mescalero Apache Tribe. It also refers to various legal entities involved, such as the Supreme Court of New Mexico and the Court of Appeals of New Mexico. The handling of the case, its implications, and the decisions given by the court are of legal nature, and are thus classified under 'Law and Crime'."
"The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is reversed. Johnson v. Virginia, 373 U.S. 61.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal terminology and refers to a court case, ""Johnson v. Virginia."" The terms ""petition for writ of certiorari,"" ""granted,"" ""judgment,"" and ""reversed"" all indicate matters related to law and the judicial system, focusing on court proceedings and decisions. This does not fit into categories like Health, Education or Technology among others, thus the most suitable classification lies within the 'Law and Crime' category."
"In Rehaif v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, the Court clarified the mens rea requirement for firearms-possession offenses under 18 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g). After Rehaif, the Government in a felon-in-possession case must prove not only that the defendant knew he possessed a firearm, but also that he knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearm. See 588 U. S., at ___. Prior to Rehaif, Gregory Greer and Michael Gary were separately convicted of being felons in possession of a firearm in violation of ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g)(1). Greer‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s conviction resulted from a jury trial during which Greer did not request‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üand the District Court did not give‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üa jury instruction requiring the jury to find that Greer knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearm. Gary pled guilty to two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. During Gary‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s plea colloquy, the District Court did not advise Gary that, if he went to trial, a jury would have to find that he knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearms. On appeal, both Greer and Gary raised new mens rea arguments based on Rehaif. Greer requested a new trial based on the District Court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s failure to instruct the jury that Greer had to know he was a felon to be found guilty. Applying plain-error review, the Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument. Gary argued that his guilty plea must be vacated because the District Court failed to advise him that, if he went to trial, a jury would have to find that he knew he was a felon. The Fourth Circuit agreed with Gary, holding that the failure to advise him of that mens rea element was a structural error that required automatic reversal even though Gary had not raised the argument in the District Court.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a Supreme Court case related to criminal law, specifically firearms possession offenses. It also talks about significant legal principles such as mens rea requirement, jury instructions and plain-error review. Additionally, it mentions different legal proceedings, including trials, pleas, and appeals. Hence, its content is distinctly related to legal issues and criminal activities."
"The Constitution of California requires that tax exemption be denied persons who advocate the unlawful overthrow of the government of the United States or of a state, or who advocate the support of a foreign government engaged in hostilities with the United States. To effectuate this constitutional provision, the California legislature enacted a statute requiring a property-tax exemption claimant to sign a statement on his tax return declaring that he does not engage in the proscribed advocacy. In No. 483, a veteran who, because of his refusal to file the oath, was denied veteran's property tax exemption, brought an action for declaratory relief in the Superior Court of Contra Costa County, California, which court held that both the constitutional provision and the tax exemption statute were invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment as restrictions on freedom of speech. The California Supreme Court reversed (48 Cal2d 903, 311 P2d 546). In No. 484, a veteran who had been denied exemption because of his failure to file the oath sued in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, California, to recover taxes paid under protest, and for declaratory relief, and that court upheld the validity of both the constitutional provision and the tax exemption statute, and the Supreme Court of California affirmed (48 Cal2d 472, 311 P2d 544).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it deals with a legal case that involves the constitution, tax exemption law, freedom of speech, and the rulings of Superior Court and the Supreme Court. It describes the legal consequences of advocating the unlawful overthrow of government or support of a host country in conflict with the United States in relation to tax exemption. The issue centers around the constitutionality of the applied laws and their validity as per the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the primary theme and content of the text fall under the domain of law and crime."
"A member of a labor union instituted an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, challenging the constitutionality under the due process clause of a Louisiana statute, and the actions thereunder of the defendants, state officials. The challenged statute created a Labor- Management Commission of Inquiry to investigate criminal violations in the field of labor-management relations upon referral by the governor, to hold public hearings for determining whether there was probable cause to believe that violations of the criminal laws had occurred, and to make public findings and recommendations to appropriate authorities with regard to the institution of criminal prosecutions, including conclusions as to specific individuals, the statute also limiting the right of a witness, who could be compelled to attend, or his counsel, to examine other witnesses and to call witnesses. The complaint contained allegations that the commission was an executive trial agency performing an accusatory function designed to publicly find the plaintiff and others guilty of violations of criminal laws without trial or procedural safeguards, allegedly for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and destroying the labor union of which he was a member, and that the defendants, acting in concert with others and in connection with the administration of the statute, had engaged in a course of conduct designed publicly to brand the plaintiff and others as criminals, including the filing of allegedly baseless criminal charges against the plaintiff. The three- judge District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, holding that the Act was constitutional, and that the other matters alleged were merely potential defenses to the pending criminal charges against the plaintiff (286 F Supp 537).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it predominately focuses on legal issues. It mentions a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana which is related to the constitutionality of a Louisiana statute and the actions taken under it by state officials. Within the case, specific legal concepts and proceedings such as a motion to dismiss, the due process clause, and the principle of a right to a fair trial are referenced. The text also discusses criminal charges and prosecutions as well as the roles of a Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry, individuals implicated, and their legal counsels. This overall focus on judicial processes, legal principles, and potential criminal activities, firmly places this text within the 'Law and Crime' category."
"Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court's statements clearly indicated that it impermissibly applied a presumption of reasonableness to his Guidelines range. The United States admitted that the lower court erred in rejecting that argument following remand. The lower court had quoted the applicable judicial precedents, but affirmed the sentence anyway after finding that the district judge did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. That was true, but beside the point. The Guidelines were not only not mandatory on sentencing courts, they were not to be presumed reasonable. It was plain from the comments of the sentencing judge that he did apply a presumption of reasonableness to defendant's Guidelines range. Under recent precedents, that constituted error.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal procedures and matters related to crime and sentencing. The text talks about a defendant's argument in a court case, mentions a district court, and refers to judicial precedents and sentencing guidelines.

"In a class action on behalf of all present and future Connecticut unemployment benefit recipients whose benefits were or would be subject to termination without a prior hearing, except for termination due to exhaustion of entitlement, a three-judge United States District Court for the District of Connecticut enjoined deprivation of benefits without a constitutionally sufficient prior hearing, on the ground that the Connecticut procedures violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (364 F Supp 922).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text discusses a legal case in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, in which unemployment benefit recipients sued for the termination of their benefits without a prior hearing.

Several rail carriers made rival applications to the Interstate Commerce Commission under 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act for authority to acquire control of another railroad company. The commission decided in favor of two applicants for joint control which proposed continued operation of the railroad company as a separate and independent carrier. (295 ICC 523.) The unsuccessful applicant then filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota to vacate the commission's order. Various parties intervened. A three-judge court sustained the order. (165 F Supp 893.),Transportation,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Transportation' because it discusses the acquisition and control of a railroad company, which is a mode of transportation. It also involves the Interstate Commerce Commission, a regulatory body in the United States that specifically oversees interstate transportation. Additionally, the discussion about rival applications by various rail carriers for control of the railroad company is a clear indication of the transportation aspects pertaining to the commercial operation of railroads."
"A black woman who had been advised that no position was available when she applied for work as a cocktail waitress at a club in New York subsequently filed a charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that the club and its manager had denied her employment because of her race. The Commission, pursuant to procedures established for processing Title VII complaints, referred the complaint to the appropriate New York administrative agency, the New York State Division of Human Rights. Ultimately, after administrative and judicial proceedings in New York, throughout which the woman was represented by counsel she had obtained, the Division's order directing that the woman be offered employment and paid back wages was affirmed. Meanwhile, during the course of the proceedings in the state system, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reassumed jurisdiction over the woman's complaint in accordance with the Title VII procedure whereby the Commission automatically assumes concurrent jurisdiction of a complaint that it refers to an appropriate state agency when the state proceedings do not end within 60 days after they are commenced. In keeping with Title VII procedures, the Commission issued a right to sue letter to the woman under 706(f)(1) of Title VII (42 USCS 2000e-5(f)(1)). Acting in accordance with the requirement of 706(f)(1) that she file her claim in federal court within 90 days of receiving the right to sue letter, the woman brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, relying, among other things, upon Title VII. Alleging that she had been denied employment because of her race, the woman sought appropriate relief in the District Court, including attorney's fees. When the parties against whom the woman had filed her complaint agreed to comply with the order of the New York State Division of Human Rights if the Court of Appeals of New York denied leave to appeal from a decision by the Supreme Court of New York upholding the Division's order, and when the state Court of Appeals denied such an appeal, the District Court dismissed the woman's complaint, but left pending her application for attorney's fees in which the woman sought attorney's fees not only for costs incurred in the federal suit, but also for costs incurred in connection with the state administrative and judicial proceedings. Ultimately denying the fee request, the District Court observed that although the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's action in issuing a right to sue letter had given the woman no choice but to preserve her rights by filing a complaint in federal court, the mere filing of such a suit did not entitle her to attorney's fees for the costs of legal representation in state proceedings (458 F Supp 79). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed (598 F2d 1253).",Civil Rights,Civil Rights,"The text was classified as 'Civil Rights' because it discusses a situation regarding racial discrimination in an employment context, which is a clear violation of an individual's civil rights. Specifically, the narrative describes a black woman's legal journey as she fights against a perceived racially discriminatory hiring practice under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Hence, the text prominently involves elements of civil rights laws and regulations, leading to its classification under 'Civil Rights'."
"Pregnant women, residents of Iowa whose children, upon birth, would be eligible for benefits under the Social Security Act's Aid to Families With Dependent Children program (42 USCS 601 et seq.), were denied welfare assistance from the state for their unborn children, and thereupon instituted a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, contending, inter alia, that the state policy of denying benefits to unborn children conflicted with the federal standard of eligibility under 406(a) of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 606(a)), which defines ""dependent child"" as a needy child, under the age of 18 (21 if a student), who has been deprived of parental support or care because of the death, continued absence from the home, or incapacity of a parent, and who is living with designated relatives. The District Court granted declaratory and injunctive relief, holding that unborn children were ""dependent children"" within the meaning of 406(a), and that by denying them benefits, the state had departed impermissibly from the federal standard of eligibility (362 F Supp 180). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (494 F2d 743).",Social Welfare,Social Welfare,"The text discusses issues related to welfare assistance, which falls under social welfare. Specifically, it talks about the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, a federal assistance program in the United States, and a court case disputing the eligibility of unborn children for this welfare benefit. Due to the emphasis on these welfare benefits and social support, the text is classified under 'Social Welfare'."
"In a proceeding instituted in a Massachusetts state court by the state attorney general, the book commonly known as ""Fanny Hill,"" relating to the adventures of a young girl who became a prostitute, was declared obscene and hence not entitled to the protection of the Federal Constitution's guaranties of freedom of speech and press. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the decree.

It involves matters of law, court decisions, and the interpretation of the Federal Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and press, which all fall under this category."
"A female flight attendant who married was forced to resign her position in 1968 by the airline with which she was employed. Subsequently, the airline's no-marriage policy was found to be violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) in an action to which the attendant was not a party, and in 1972, she was rehired by the airline as a new employee with no seniority credit for her prior service. She later filed suit seeking seniority to the date of her initial employment, and alleged that the airline was guilty of a present, continuing violation of Title VII because its seniority system treated her less favorably than males hired between 1968 and 1972 and perpetuated the consequences of the past discrimination. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was time-barred due to the plaintiff's failure to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 90 days of her separation in 1968, as required under 706(d) of the Act (presently 180 days under redesignated 706(e), 42 USCS 2000e-5(e)). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed (534 F2d 1247).",Civil Rights,Civil Rights,"The text discusses a case of gender discrimination where a female flight attendant was forced to resign because she got married, which is a violation of her civil rights. This case is connected to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Therefore, the text is classified under 'Civil Rights'."
"An application for habeas corpus brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging unlawful detention under a sentence of imprisonment following a trial in a Texas state court in which petitioner was, according to his claim, denied due process of law, was dismissed by the District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. (258 F2d 937.) The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to review this judgment (359 US 924, 3 L ed 2d 627, 79 S Ct 610), but, before the case was heard by the court, petitioner was released from the state prison, having served his full sentence.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal issues related to unlawful detention, imprisonment, trials in courts including district courts, court of appeals, the United States Supreme Court, habeas corpus application, and denials of due process of law.

"Akamai Technologies, Inc., a respondent here, is the exclusive licensee of a patent that claims a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network (CDN). Petitioner, Limelight Networks, Inc., also operates a CDN and carries out several of the steps claimed in the patent, but its customers, rather than Limelight itself, perform a step of the patent known as ""tagging."" Under Federal Circuit case law, liability for direct infringement under 35 U. . C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º271(a) requires performance of all steps of a method patent to be attributable to a single party. This position was most recently refined in Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318. The D district Court concluded that Limelight could not have directly infringed the patent at issue because performance of the tagging step could not be attributed to it. The en banc Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a defendant who performed some steps of a method patent and encouraged others to perform the rest could be liable for inducement of infringement even if no one was liable for direct infringement. The en bane court concluded that the evidence could support liability for Limelight on an inducement theory and remanded for further proceedings",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal matter involving a case of alleged patent infringement, which is a form of intellectual property crime. The text mentions multiple legal entities such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., and the Federal Circuit court.

"The instant cases deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation, and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege against self-incrimination. Without specific concentration on the facts of these cases, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion by Warren, Ch. J., expressing the views of five members of the Court, laid down the governing principles, the most important of which is that, as a constitutional prerequisite to the admissibility of such statements, the suspect must, in the absence of a clear, intelligent waiver of the constitutional rights involved, be warned prior to questioning that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed. Clark, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part, expressed the view that the admissibility of a confession obtained by custodial interrogation should depend on the ""totality of circumstances."" Harlan, Stewart, and White, JJ., dissented, expressing the view, in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Harlan, that the decision of the Court represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful conseque es for the country at large, and in an opinion written by Mr. Justice White, that the proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids in-custody interrogations without the warnings specified above and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it deals with legal issues and processes related to law enforcement and the justice system. It discusses the matter of police interrogation and the constitutional rights afforded to individuals, such as the right against self-incrimination and the right to an attorney.

This indicates the text revolves around law enforcement practices, constitutional rights, and legal interpretations, which fall under the category of 'Law and Crime'."
"In October 1993, Tara Williams drove two of her friends to a liquor store in Long Beach, California, with the intent to commit a robbery. Williams waited in the car to serve as the getaway driver while her friends stole the cash from the liquor store and fatally shot the store's owner. Five years later, Williams was apprehended and charged with first-degree murder. At trial, the judge discharged a juror for bias and replaced that juror with an alternate, after which the jury convicted Williams for first-degree murder. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. While Williams' petition to the California Supreme Court was pending, that court decided a case that held that a court abused its discretion when it dismissed a juror who seemed to disagree with the other jurors. Based on that decision, the California Supreme Court remanded Williams' case, and the California Court of Appeal issued a revised opinion holding that the lower court had not abused its discretion by dismissing the juror. Williams filed a federal habeas corpus petition, but the district court denied relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which restricts federal habeas relief to cases that have already been adjudicated on their merits in state court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the California Court of Appeal had disregarded Williams' argument that dismissal of the juror in question violated the Sixth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and held that the California court had adjudicated the case on the merits, even if the Sixth Amendment claim was not explicitly addressed. On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's denial of habeas relief.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a series of legal proceedings regarding a crime, specifically a robbery and murder case involving Tara Williams.

"The driver of a car which had been traveling at 69 miles per hour, on an Ohio highway where the posted speed limit was 45 miles per hour, was stopped by an Ohio county deputy. The deputy obtained the driver's license and ran a computer check which indicated that the driver had no previous violations. The deputy then (1) asked the driver to step out of his car, (2) turned on a mounted video camera, (3) issued a verbal warning to the driver, and (4) returned the driver's license. The deputy then said to the driver, ""One question before you get gone: are you carrying any illegal contraband in your car? Any weapons of any kind, drugs, anything like that?"" When the driver answered ""no,"" the deputy asked if he could search the car. The driver consented, and the deputy found a small amount of marijuana and a pill which was determined to be methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The driver was then arrested and charged under Ohio law with knowing possession of a controlled substance. After the accused's motion to suppress the evidence found in his car was denied, the accused pleaded no contest and was found guilty. On appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals, reversing, ruled that the search of the accused's car resulted from an unlawful detention (1994 Ohio App LEXIS 1745). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio, affirming, expressed the view that (1) when the motivation behind a police officer's continued detention of a person stopped for a traffic violation was not related to the purpose of the original stop and the continued detention was not based on any articulable facts giving rise to a suspicion of separate illegal activity, the continued detention constituted an illegal seizure; and (2) the right, guaranteed by the ""federal and Ohio Constitutions,"" to be secure in one's person and property required that any attempt at consensual interrogation, after a valid detention, of a citizen stopped for traffic offenses must be preceded by the phrase ""At this time you legally are free to go"" or by words of similar import (73 Ohio St 3d 650, 653 N.E.2d 695).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal case involving a traffic violation, potential illegal possession of controlled substances, and an appeal related to the legality of a car search conducted by a police officer. The text references legal concepts such as a motion to suppress evidence, the rules for detention and search by law enforcement, and the interpretations of law by courts of appeal and the state Supreme Court. All these elements are directly related to law enforcement, court proceedings, and the interpretation of the law; therefore, it is categorized under 'Law and Crime'."
"""Personal"" ordinarily referred to individuals, and was often used to mean precisely the opposite of business-related. Dictionaries also suggested that ""personal"" did not ordinarily relate to artificial ""persons."" 1 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 1 defined ""person"" to include corporations, but there was a difference between ""person"" and ""personal."" Exemption 7(C) referred not just to the word ""personal,"" but to ""personal privacy."" The scope of a corporation's ""privacy"" interests were not at issue. The discrete question was whether Congress used ""personal privacy"" to refer to the privacy of artificial persons in Exemption 7(C). The corporation's cited cases were too far afield to be of help. The ""personal privacy"" phrase of Exemption 6, ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 552(b)(6), was pertinent. When Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in place ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 552(b)(4), an exemption that plainly covered a corporation's commercial and financial information, and another described as relating to ""individuals."" Exemption 7(C)'s language tracked the latter. Exemption 7(C)'s protection against disclosure of law enforcement information on the ground that it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy did not extend to corporations.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' as it discusses legal context and principles, specifically referring to legislative exemptions which are related to law enforcement and personal privacy. It also debates the interpretation of the term ""personal"" in legal terms, and whether it applies to corporations. The text also has references to Congress enacting these exemptions, which alludes to the legal process of legislating law. These aspects of the text make it relevant to the 'Law and Crime' category."
"Defendant, a labor union officer, was indicted and convicted in a Washington state court on a charge of embezzlement of union funds. His conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Washington, the judges dividing equally. (56 Wash 2d 474, 349 P2d 387, adhered to on reh 56 Wash 2d 474, 353 P2d 429.) He attacked his conviction in the United States Supreme Court as invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. His attack was based primarily on voluminous and continuous adverse publicity circulated by news media in the vicinity of the place of the trial, it being alleged that this publicity prevented the selection of a fair grand jury and petit jury. As to the grand jury, it was claimed specifically that it was unfairly impaneled and instructed, and that a Washington statute permitting persons in custody to challenge grand jurors denied equal protection to persons not in custody, such as the defendant, who were investigated by grand juries.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it involves the legal process of a defendant being indicted, convicted, and appealing his case. It makes mention of crimes such as embezzlement of union funds, jury selection, and potentially unfair legal processes within the court system. The mention of laws and law enforcement, civil liberties, and the criminal act of embezzlement contribute to its classification under 'Law and Crime'. The text discusses the Supreme Court and references the Fourteenth Amendment, further indicating a strong alignment with this category."
"Section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 USCS Appx 453) empowers the President, by proclamation, to require the registration of ""every male citizen"" and male resident aliens between the ages of 18 and 26 in order to facilitate eventual conscription under the Act. Although registration for the draft was discontinued in 1975, President Carter determined in early 1980 that it was necessary to reactivate the registration process, and recommended that funds be transferred from the Department of Defense to the Selective Service System for this purpose. He also recommended that Congress amend the Act to permit the registration and conscription of women as well as men. Congress agreed that is was necessary to reactivate the registration process; however, it allocated only those funds necessary to register males and, although it considered the question at great length, it declined to amend the Act to permit the registration of women. Thereafter, the President ordered the registration of specified groups of young men pursuant to 3 of the Act. Ultimately ruling in a case which had been brought nearly ten years earlier in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by several men subject to registration for the draft and subsequent induction into the armed services, a three-judge Federal District Court held that the Act's gender-based discrimination violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and permanently enjoined registration under the Act (509 F Supp 586).",Defense,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Defense' because it primarily discusses the Military Selective Service Act, which is a legislative measure directly related to the United States Armed Services.

"A college student filed an action in a Federal District Court under 42 USCS 1983 and claimed that a police detective employed by an Illinois city had deprived the student of substantive due process under the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment by infringing his ""liberty interest"" to be free from criminal prosecution except upon probable cause. The student included allegations to the effect that (1) an undercover informant reported to the detective that the informant had bought ""cocaine,"" which substance turned out to be baking powder; (2) the detective testified about the transaction to an Illinois grand jury, which indicted the man whom the informant named for selling a substance which looked like an illegal drug; (3) when the detective went to serve the arrest warrant, he discovered that the man, who was a retired pharmacist, was unlikely to have committed the offense; (4) after further contact between the detective and the informant, a criminal information was issued charging the student, who was a son of the pharmacist, with selling the ""look-alike"" substance, followed by the issuance of an arrest warrant; (5) the student surrendered to the detective, but denied his guilt and was released after posting bond, on conditions including that he not leave the state without permission; and (6) while an Illinois state court, at a preliminary hearing, found probable cause to bind the student over for trial based on the detective's testimony that the student had sold the look-alike substance to the informant, the court, at a later pretrial hearing, dismissed the criminal action on the ground that the charge did not state an offense under Illinois law. The District Court, however, granted the detective's motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint did not state a claim under 1983. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that prosecution without probable cause was a constitutional tort actionable under 1983 only if accompanied by incarceration, loss of employment, or some other palpable consequence (975 F2d 343).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal case involving police detective actions, prosecuting without probable cause, invocation of constitutional amendments and laws, court proceedings in both district and appeals court, and actions taken under a specific United States Code.

"A black accused, who was charged in a state trial court in Missouri with a robbery that did not involve a gun, objected to the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike two black men from the jury panel. The prosecutor explained that he struck (1) the first juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard; and (2) the second juror because (a) the juror had a mustache and a beard, and (b) the prosecutor feared that the juror, having had a gun pointed at him during a robbery, would believe that a robbery required a gun. The trial court overruled the objection, impaneled the jury, and convicted the accused of robbery. On direct appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals (1) expressed the view that under the decision in Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712--that a state prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from a jury trying a black defendant may be the basis for a claim of purposeful discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment--the circumstances failed to raise the necessary inference of racial discrimination; and (2) affirmed the judgment of the trial court (747 SW2d 772). The accused filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 USCS 2254, asserting a Batson claim. After the District Court denied the claim, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (1) expressed the view that the prosecutor's asserted reasons for striking the first juror were not legitimate race-neutral reasons and that the trial court had erred in finding that striking the juror had not been intentional discrimination, and (2) reversed the judgment of the District Court (25 F3d 679).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it revolves around a legal case involving a robbery crime, discrimination based on jury selection, and trial procedures.

"The decedent purchased some Series E United States Savings Bonds which were issued in co-ownership form, some in the names of the decedent or her granddaughter, and others in the names of the decedent or another granddaughter.
