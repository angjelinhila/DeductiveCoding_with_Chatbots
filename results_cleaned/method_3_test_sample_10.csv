"Under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the Federal Government partially reimburses states that provide financial assistance to families with needy dependent children, as long as the states administer their assistance plans in conformity with federal statutes (42 USCS 601-615) and United States Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) regulations. Although the federal statute defines neither term, it requires the consideration of a family's ""income"" and ""resources"" when determining whether the family is needy (42 USCS 602(a)(7)(A)), and prohibits the providing of AFDC benefits for any month in which either income or resources exceed state-prescribed limits (42 USCS 602(a)(7)(B)). Because income eligibility and resources eligibility are separately computed, and because state limits for the two generally differ, whether, and for how long, a family that acquired a sum of money was rendered ineligible for ADFC benefits at times depended on whether the sum was classified as income or as a resource. Under an amendment to the AFDC statute (42 USCS 602(a)(17)), if a given sum of money was treated as a resource, a family would be ineligible only until it spent enough of the sum to bring the amount down to the state's resource limit, but if the money was treated as income, a family would remain ineligible, no matter how much was spent, for the statutory period. In response to the AFDC amendment, the Virginia Department of Social Services revised its regulations to treat various lump-sum payments, including personal injury awards, as income rather than as resources, although the regulations continued to treat property damage awards as resources. Personal injury award recipients, who were disqualified from Virginia's AFDC program pursuant to the revised state regulations, filed a class-action suit in the United States District Court for the District of Western Virginia against the Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Social Services, alleging that the treatment of personal injury awards as income was inconsistent with the AFDC statute. The District Court granted summary judgment in the class' favor, holding that the common meaning of the term ""income"" precluded application of that term to personal injury awards, and that it was irrational to treat personal injury awards as income while treating awards for property loss as resources. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed in all respects (774 F2d 1270).",Social Welfare
"The petitioner, who was convicted for larceny in an Ohio state court, previously came before the United States Supreme Court (382 US 286, 15 L ed 2d 337, 85 S Ct 445) with the claim that the prosecutor's comment upon his failure to testify during his trial violated the constitutional right to remain silent, and the Supreme Court then granted certiorari, vacated the conviction, and remanded the case to the Ohio Supreme Court for further proceedings in the light of the decision in Griffin v California, 380 US 609, 14 L ed 2d 106, 85 S Ct 1229, which held it unconstitutional for a prosecutor or trial judge to make adverse comment upon a defendant's failure to testify in a state criminal trial. Following remand, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the petitioner's conviction solely on the ground that he had failed to object to the proscribed comment in the state courts, and that such failure precluded the Ohio appellate courts from considering the claim as to the infringement of his federal constitutional rights.

"Several motion picture studios, alleging that the operators of a resort hotel had infringed the studios' copyrights in various films by renting videodiscs to guests for viewing in hotel rooms, filed an action against the operators in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The operators filed a counterclaim charging the studios with violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1, 2), based in part on the allegation that the studios' copyright action was a mere sham which cloaked underlying acts of monopolization and conspiracy to restrain trade. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the operators on the studios' copyright claim (228 USPQ 743), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (866 F2d 278). On remand, the District Court granted the studios' motion for summary judgment on the operators' antitrust counterclaim, on the grounds that (1) the studios had clearly sought and expected a favorable judgment on the copyright claim and had had probable cause to bring such an action; and (2) the copyright action therefore was not a ""sham"" and was entitled to antitrust immunity under the ""Noerr-Pennington"" doctrine as a legitimate effort to influence governmental action (1990-1 CCH Trade Cases 68,971). The Court of Appeals, affirming, (1) characterized ""sham"" litigation as involving either misrepresentations in the adjudicatory process or the pursuit of a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims instituted without probable cause and regardless of the merits; and (2) noted that the operators had neither alleged that the copyright action involved misrepresentations nor challenged the District Court's finding of probable cause, but had argued only that the action was a sham because the studios had not honestly believed the action to be meritorious (944 F2d 1525).",Law and Crime
"In an action brought on behalf of all persons involuntarily confined in the forensic unit of a state hospital, which action challenged the constitutionality of treatment at the hospital, the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, after a trial, found constitutional violations in five of the six general areas of treatment. Subsequent to the trial, the representatives of the certified plaintiff class of involuntarily confined inmates filed a request for attorneys' fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (42 USCS 1988), which provides that in federal civil rights actions, ""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."" After determining that the plaintiff class was the prevailing party under 42 USCS 1988, even though they had not succeeded on every claim, the District Court refused to eliminate from the fee award compensation for hours spent on unsuccessful claims. The District Court found that the significant extent of the relief obtained clearly justified the award of a reasonable attorney's fee.

"Two guards-James Madigan and petitioner Michael Ross-undertook to move respondent Shaidon Blake, a Maryland inmate, to the prison's segregation unit. During the transfer, Madigan assaulted Blake, punching him several times in the face. Blake reported the incident to a corrections officer, who referred the matter to the Maryland prison system's Internal Investigative Unit (JIU). The IIU, which has authority under state law to investigate employee misconduct, issued a report condemning Madigan's actions. Blake subsequently sued both guards under 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1983, alleging excessive force and failure to take protective action. A jury found Madigan liable. But Ross raised (as an affirmative defense) the exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), which demands that an inmate exhaust ""such administrative remedies as are available"" before bringing suit to challenge prison conditions. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1997e(a). Ross argued that Blake had fied suit without first following the prison's prescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy, while Blake argued that the IIU investigation was a substitute for those procedures. The District Court sided with Ross and dismissed the suit. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that ""special circumstances"" can excuse a failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements-particularly where the inmate reasonably, even though mistakenly, believed he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.",Law and Crime
"Respondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought federal habeas relief. His counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales' mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuit's Rohan decision, what is now 18 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent. The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales' input. Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash-which gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appeals-the court granted the writ, concluding that ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination. Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings. The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. Applying the Ninth Circuit's Rohan test, it determined that Carter's assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims. It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S. 312 (Rees 1), located a statutory right to competence in 18 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º4241, and found that a court could employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to forgo his petition. It thus ordered that Carter's petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.",Law and Crime

"The Internal Revenue Service denied the taxpayers' request for abatement of interest assessed over a four-year period. The Court agreed with the lower courts that the Tax Court provided the exclusive forum for judicial review of a failure to abate interest under 26 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(e)(1). The Court found that ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h) was a precisely drawn statute that pre-empted more general remedies. Further, the Court regarded the remedy provided by ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h) as exclusive because it was enacted against a backdrop of decisions that uniformly rejected the possibility of any review of the Secretary of the Treasury's ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(e)(1) determinations. Despite Congress's failure to explicitly define the Tax Court's jurisdiction as exclusive, the Court found it plain that the terms of ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h) controlled all requests for review of ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(e)(1) decisions, including the forum for adjudication. Although Congress eliminated the previously recognized barrier to judicial review by providing an abuse of discretion standard in ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h), the Court declined the taxpayers' invitation to isolate one feature of ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h) to permit the taxpayers to circumvent the other limiting features of ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 6404(h).",Law and Crime

"Prior to Congress' enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (PL 104-104, 110 Stat 56), states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local telephone market to a local exchange carrier (LEC), which owned the various forms of equipment that constituted a local exchange network. The 1996 Act ended such state-granted monopolies and subjected incumbent LECs to various duties--including the obligation under 47 USCS 251(c) to share networks with competitors--that were intended to facilitate market entry. Under 251(c), a requesting carrier was permitted to obtain access to an incumbent's network by various means, such as (1) leasing elements of the incumbent's network ""on an unbundled basis,"" or (2) interconnecting the requesting carrier's own facilities with the incumbent's network. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules implementing the 1996 Act's local-competition provisions, several incumbent LECs and state commissions challenged some of these rules by filing petitions for review which were consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Court of Appeals concluded, among other matters, that (1) the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding (a) pricing ( 47 CFR 51.503 and 51.505), (b) state review of pre-existing interconnection agreements between incumbent LECs and other carriers ( 47 CFR 51.303), and (c) rural exemptions ( 47 CFR 51.405); (2) with respect to the FCC's primary ""unbundling"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.319), the FCC--in specifying the network elements available to requesting carriers--reasonably implemented the requirement of 47 USCS 251(d)(2) that the FCC consider whether access to proprietary elements was ""necessary"" and whether lack of access to nonproprietary elements would ""impair"" an entrant's ability to provide local service; (3) the FCC's rule forbidding incumbent LECs to separate already-combined network elements before leasing them to competitors ( 47 CFR 51.315(b)) had to be vacated as requiring access to those elements on a bundled rather than an unbundled--that is, physically separated--basis; and (4) the FCC's ""pick and choose"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.809)--enabling a competing LEC to demand access to any individual interconnection, service, or network element arrangement on the same terms and conditions that the incumbent LEC gave anyone else in an agreement approved pursuant to 47 USCS 252, but not obligating the competing LEC to accept the agreement's other provisions--had to be vacated as deterring the ""voluntarily negotiated agreements"" that the 1996 Act favored (120 F3d 753, 1997 US App LEXIS 18183). In a separate opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding dialing parity, that is, an arrangement enabling a new entrant's customers to make calls without having to dial an access code ( 47 CFR 51.205-51.215) (124 F3d 934, 1997 US App LEXIS 22343).",Technology
"The accused--who admitted to killing, or participating in the killing of, at least 26 people--pleaded guilty in an Idaho trial court to a charge of first-degree murder arising out of an incident in which the accused had brutally beaten a fellow prison inmate to death. After a sentencing hearing, the trial judge (1) found beyond a reasonable doubt five statutory aggravating circumstances, including the circumstance that the accused had exhibited ""utter disregard for human life,"" and observed in this context that the accused had intentionally killed the other inmate after the inmate had been rendered helpless; (2) determined that mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances; and (3) sentenced the accused to death. The Supreme Court of Idaho, after temporarily remanding for the trial judge to reimpose sentence in open court with the accused present, affirmed the accused's sentence and ruled that the ""utter disregard"" circumstance was not unconstitutionally vague under the limiting construction imposed by a previous decision of that court, which had construed the ""utter disregard"" circumstance as reflective of acts or circumstances exhibiting ""the highest, the utmost, callous disregard for human life, i.e., the cold-blooded, pitiless slayer"" (102 Idaho 362, 670 P2d 463). The accused subsequently filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho. The District Court denied relief; but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, and directed the District Court to grant the petition on remand, on the grounds that the trial court had erred in, among other actions, (1) applying the ""utter disregard"" aggravating circumstance, which was unconstitutionally vague, and (2) refusing to allow the accused to present new mitigating evidence at his resentencing hearing (947 F2d 873).",Law and Crime

"A man accused of planning the armed robbery of a home, which plan included killing the occupants of the home, and of participating in the robbery, in the course of which the occupants were in fact shot to death by another robber, was indicted for capital murder and was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi. In the sentencing phase of the trial, the circuit court instructed the jury on statutory aggravating factors, including the factor that the murder was ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,"" as to which factor the court followed the statutory language for the most part and offered no further definition. The jury found that three statutory aggravating factors were present in the case, including the ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" factor, and the accused was sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed the conviction and sentence (454 So 2d 468), and the United States Supreme Court, in 1985, denied certiorari. After unsuccessfully seeking state postconviction relief, the accused filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which petition contended in part that the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating factor was so vague as to render the sentence arbitrary in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment. The District Court, in denying the petition, found the vagueness claim to be (1) procedurally barred, and (2) without merit (675 F Supp 356). In 1988, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed on the merits, as it held that there was no constitutional infirmity in the jury's consideration of the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating factor because the two other aggravating factors were unchallenged (862 F2d 1108).

"An oil corporation contracted with another company for the latter to perform certain completion operations on oil drilling platforms offshore of Louisiana, the drilling company promising, as part of the agreement, to indemnify the oil company for all claims resulting directly or indirectly from the work. During a storm occurring while work was in progress, an employee of the drilling company working on an oil drilling platform above the seabed of the outer continental shelf was taken safely aboard a boat chartered by the oil company, but was subsequently injured while assisting crewmen of the boat to evacuate workers from other platforms. The employee brought a suit for damages in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging negligence by the oil company and the boat owner. The oil company filed a third-party complaint for indemnification against the drilling company, but in its third-party answer, the drilling company denied that the state court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, arguing that the oil company's cause of action arose under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 USCS 1331 et seq.) and that the Act invested exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction in a United States District Court. The Texas trial court rejected this contention, and the case went to trial before a jury. In submitting the case to the jury, the trial court denied a request by the drilling company to instruct the jury that personal injury damage awards are not subject to federal income taxation and that they should not increase or decrease an award in contemplation of tax consequences. The jury found the oil company negligent and awarded the employee damages for his injuries, and it also found that the employee sustained his injuries while performing work subject to the contract of indemnification. Based on the two verdicts, the trial judge entered judgment against the drilling company in the amount of the damage award. On appeal, the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, Fourteenth Supreme Judicial District, affirmed, holding that the Texas state courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over the causes of action, there being no explicit command in the Act that federal-court jurisdiction be exclusive, and that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation (594 SW2d 496).

The FTCA, as originally enacted, afforded tort victims a remedy against the United States, but did not preclude suit against the alleged tortfeasor as sole or joint defendant. Several agency-specific statutes postdating the FTCA, however, immunized certain federal employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of their official duties. One such statute, the Gonzalez Act, makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel. 10 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1089(a).

The Court of Appeals concluded, among other matters, that (1) the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding (a) pricing ( 47 CFR 51.503 and 51.505), (b) state review of pre-existing interconnection agreements between incumbent LECs and other carriers ( 47 CFR 51.303), and (c) rural exemptions ( 47 CFR 51.405); (2) with respect to the FCC's primary ""unbundling"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.319), the FCC--in specifying the network elements available to requesting carriers--reasonably implemented the requirement of 47 USCS 251(d)(2) that the FCC consider whether access to proprietary elements was ""necessary"" and whether lack of access to nonproprietary elements would ""impair"" an entrant's ability to provide local service; (3) the FCC's rule forbidding incumbent LECs to separate already-combined network elements before leasing them to competitors ( 47 CFR 51.315(b)) had to be vacated as requiring access to those elements on a bundled rather than an unbundled--that is, physically separated--basis; and (4) the FCC's ""pick and choose"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.809)--enabling a competing LEC to demand access to any individual interconnection, service, or network element arrangement on the same terms and conditions that the incumbent LEC gave anyone else in an agreement approved pursuant to 47 USCS 252, but not obligating the competing LEC to accept the agreement's other provisions--had to be vacated as deterring the ""voluntarily negotiated agreements"" that the 1996 Act favored (120 F3d 753, 1997 US App LEXIS 18183). In a separate opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding dialing parity, that is, an arrangement enabling a new entrant's customers to make calls without having to dial an access code ( 47 CFR 51.205-51.215) (124 F3d 934, 1997 US App LEXIS 22343).",Technology
"Registration and barratry statutes enacted by the Virginia legislature as part of its general plan of massive resistance to the integration of schools of the state were challenged by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia as invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court, finding the statutes free from ambiguity, declared them unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement. (159 F Supp 503.)",Civil Rights
"The plaintiff, a manufacturer of shoes and customer of the defendant manufacturer of shoe machinery, brought, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the present treble damage antitrust action based on defendant's monopolization of the shoe machinery market by offering its machines only for leasing but not for sale. In support of its action, plaintiff relied solely on a decree in favor of the United States in a former action against defendant as prima facie evidence under 15 USC 16(a). The District Court awarded damages, in the amount of $ 4,239,609. (245 F Supp 258.) On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the finding of liability but disagreed with the District Court on certain questions relating to the damage award.

"A retail store was located in a shopping plaza within the metropolitan area of Hartford, Connecticut. All of the store's 200 employees lived in the Hartford metropolitan area; none of them lived on the store owner's property. The store owner was a joint owner of the shopping plaza's parking lot, which was separated from a public highway by a 46-foot-wide grassy strip, almost all of which was public property. In a campaign to organize the store employees, a union inserted a full-page advertisement in a Hartford newspaper, but the advertisement drew little response. Subsequently, union organizers who were not store employees entered the parking lot and placed handbills on the windshields of cars parked in a corner of the lot that was used mostly by the store employees. Each time this occurred, store personnel asked the organizers to leave and the handbills were removed. The organizers relocated to the grassy strip, from where they displayed picket signs over a period of 7 months. The organizers were able to secure the names and addresses of 41 employees, approximately 20 percent of the total. The union sent four mailings to these employees and made some attempts to contact them by phone or by home visits. These efforts resulted in only one signed union authorization card. Alleging that the store owner had violated 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 158(a)(1)) by barring the organizers from the parking lot, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). An administrative law judge ruled in the union's favor. The NLRB, affirming, (1) applied a standard under which (a) the employees' rights under 7 of the NLRA (29 USCS 157)--which guarantees employees the right of self-organization--were balanced against the store owner's property rights, and (b) the availability of reasonably effective alternative means of communication was considered; (2) found that the union had no such alternative means available; and (3) held that the store owner was required by 7 to grant access to the organizers. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the store owner's petition for review and enforced the NLRB's order (914 F2d 313).",Labor
