"Defendants' convictions, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, of possession, custody, and control of an unregistered still, in violation of 26 USC 5601(a)(1), were reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on the grounds that the trial court, in instructing the jury, read the provision of 5601(b)(1), authorizing an inference of guilt from defendants' unexplained presence at the site of the still, and that the instruction, and the statutory inference embodied therein, violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

"Petitioner Sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert respondent United States Steel Corporation requires workers to wear because of hazards at its steel plants. U. S. Steel contends that this donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collectivebargaining agreement with petitioners' union. That provision's validity depends on 29 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º203(o), which allows parties to collectively bargain over whether ""time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday"" must be compensated. The District Court granted U. S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, holding that petitioners' donning and doffing constituted ""changing clothes"" under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º203(o). It also assumed that any time spent donning and doffing items that were not ""clothes"" was ""de minimis"" and hence noncompensable. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.",Labor
"Responding to incidents in which severely handicapped infants were denied life-extending medical treatment, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) promulgated a set of regulations governing health care for such infants pursuant to its authority under 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USCS 794). In their final form, these regulations included provisions which (1) required federally assisted hospitals to post notices stating that 504 prohibits the withholding of nourishment and medically beneficial treatment from infants solely on the basis of their handicap; (2) required designated state agencies to establish procedures insuring that they use their full authority to prevent such neglect, including requirements that hospitals report such cases to the agencies; (3) allowed expedited access to patient records, with or without parental consent; and (4) allowed expedited action to enforce 504 and protect such infants. Various medical organizations filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which, at least in part, challenged the validity of these regulations and sought to enjoin their enforcement. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the medical organizations (585 F Supp 541), stating that the case was controlled by a previous decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case involving a seriously deformed newborn infant whose parents had refused to consent to surgical procedures necessary to prolong the infant's life, wherein it was held that 504 did not authorize HHS to obtain pertinent hospital records because that statute was not intended to apply to treatment decisions involving defective newborn infants (729 F2d 144). The Court of Appeals, in accordance with its previous decision, summarily affirmed the District Court's judgment.",Health
"An appeal taken by short-haul terminal railroads from a judgment of a three-judge District Court which, although rejecting the appellants' contention that determination of a uniform rate for the hiring by these railroads of cars of long-haul trunk line railroads was beyond the adjudicatory jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under 5(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act and lay exclusively within its rule- making power under 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, set aside on the merits an order of the Commission which upheld as reasonable per diem rates as fixed in an agreement prepared by the Association of American Railroads, will be dismissed as prematurely raising the question of the Commission's jurisdiction, where the Commission, in its memorandum before the United States Supreme Court, expressed its readiness to proceed in accordance with the terms of the District Court's remand requiring the Commission to consider an alternative method of compensation (which would introduce a mileage factor into the per diem), since the Commission proceedings on remand may lose the characteristics of a 5(b) declaration and take on those of a 1(14)(a) rule-making procedure, thereby causing the question sought to be reviewed by the present appeal to disappear; however the appeal will be dismissed without prejudice to raising the ""adjudicatory"" issue again, if it survives the further Commission proceedings.",Domestic Commerce

"At a nonjury criminal trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio of a defendant who had been charged with falsifying his federal income tax return in violation of 18 USCS 1001 by falsely denying that he maintained a foreign bank account, the District Court found that the defendant was guilty on the basis of all the evidence, but ultimately, the District Court set aside the conviction, ruling, among other things, that a loan guarantee agreement in which the defendant pledged funds in a foreign bank account had been seized by the government as the result of a flagrantly illegal search of a bank officer's briefcase, and that even though such illegal search had not violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, the agreement had to be suppressed as evidence against the defendant under the court's exercise of its inherent supervisory power as a federal court (434 F Supp 113).

"Land developer Steven Sherman paid $2.7 million to purchase land in the town of Chester (Town) for a housing subdivision. He also sought the Town's approval of his development plan. About a decade later, he filed this suit in New York state court, claiming that the Town had obstructed his plans for the subdivision, forcing him to spend around $5.5 million to comply with its demands and driving him to the brink of personal bankruptcy. Sherman asserted, among other claims, a regulatory takings claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Town removed the case to a Federal District Court, which dismissed the takings claim as unripe. The Second Circuit reversed that determination and remanded for the case to go forward. On remand, real estate development company Laroe Estates, Inc. (respondent here), filed a motion to intervene of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), which requires a court to permit intervention by a litigant that ""claims an interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest."" Laroe alleged that it had paid Sherman more than $2.5 million in relation to the development project and the subject property, that its resulting equitable interest in the property would be impaired if it could not intervene, and that Sherman would not adequately represent its interest. Laroe filed, inter alia, an intervenor's complaint asserting a regulatory takings claim that was substantively identical to Sherman's and seeking a judgment awarding Laroe compensation for the taking of Laroe's interest in the property at issue. The District Court denied Laroe's motion to intervene, concluding that its equitable interest did not confer standing. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that an intervenor of right is not required to meet Article III's standing requirements.",Housing
"An independent government agency charged by the Massachusetts Legislature with providing water-supply services, sewage collection, and treatment and disposal services for eastern Massachusetts was ordered by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to build sewage treatment facilities for the cleaning of Boston Harbor. Under the agency's enabling statute and Massachusetts' public bidding laws, the agency was to (1) provide funds for construction, (2) own the facilities to be built, (3) establish all bid conditions, (4) decide all contract awards, (5) pay the contractors, and (6) generally supervise the project. An engineering firm, hired as the agency's project manager, negotiated a labor agreement which, among other items, (1) recognized a particular union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all craft employees, and (2) established a 10-year no-strike commitment. The agency approved the agreement and adopted a bid specification, which required each contractor and subcontractor to agree to abide by the agreement and to be bound by the agreement's provisions. In response to a charge by a contractors' association that the agreement violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 151 et seq.), the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board found that (1) the agreement was a valid prehire agreement under 8(f) of the NLRA (29 USCS 158(f)), and (2) the agreement's provisions limiting work on the project to contractors who agreed to abide by the agreement were lawful under a construction-industry proviso to 8(e) of the NLRA (29 USCS 158(e)). An organization representing nonunion construction industry employers--seeking, among other items, to enjoin enforcement of the bid specification as pre-empted under the NLRA--brought suit in the District Court against the agency, the engineering firm, and the union. The District Court denied the organization's motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, expressing the view that the bid specification was pre-empted under the NLRA (135 BNA LRRM 2713, 117 CCH LC 10392, 1990-2 CCH Trade Cases 69229). The Court of Appeals subsequently vacated this opinion, but on rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals again reversed the District Court, expressing the view that (1) the agency's intrusion into the bargaining process was pervasive and was not a permissible sort of peripheral regulation; and (2) the bid specification was pre-empted, because the agency was regulating activities that Congress intended to be unrestricted by governmental power (935 F2d 345).",Labor
"The Secretary of Labor brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana to invalidate a local union's election of officers on the ground that a meeting attendance rule, which was contained in the international union's constitution and which was binding on the local, violated 401(e) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (29 USCS 481(e)), providing that every union member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate and to hold office in the union, subject to ""reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed."" The District Court dismissed the complaint, finding that 401(e) was not violated by the meeting attendance rule which limited eligibility for local union office to members who had attended at least one-half of the local's regular meetings for the three years prior to the election, unless such attendance was prevented by union activities or working hours.

"Orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission establishing, with respect to two connecting carriers, through routes and prescribing joint through rates for specified commodities were attacked (in Nos. 332, 333, and 334) by the carrier which had invoked the Commission's authority, on the grounds (1) that the Commission had placed undue geographical limitations on its order establishing through routes because of its failure to recognize the existence of certain through routes; and (2) that the Commission had erred in not establishing joint through rates for all commodities. The District Court upset the Commission's order, ruling that the evidence established the existence of the through routes not recognized by the Commission. The other carrier, in separate litigation (Nos. 117, 118, and 119), attacked the Commission's order in so far as it required establishment of any through routes or joint through rates, and in this case the District Court accepted the Commission's finding as to the nonexistence of the through routes, sustained the Commission's order in establishing through rates and joint through rates with respect to commodities requiring in-transit services, but refused to sustain the Commission's action relating to commodities not requiring such services.",Transportation

This motion was denied by the District Court, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the conviction--holding that the United States had not fulfilled its burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt--and, rather than terminating the case against the defendant, remanded to the District Court for a determination of whether a directed verdict of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered (547 F2d 968).",Law and Crime

The man then brought an action for defamation against the author and publishers of the book in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, claiming that passages in the book stating that he had been indicted for espionage and had been a Soviet agent were false and defamatory. Granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the District Court held that the man was a ""public figure"" who, under the First Amendment rule for defamation actions, had to prove that the defendants published a defamatory falsehood with actual malice, and that although the book appeared to state falsely that the man had been indicted for espionage, the evidence raised no genuine issue with respect to the existence of actual malice on the defendants' part (429 F Supp 167).

"Provisions of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA) (1) required the Secretary of the Interior's approval before coal mining leases negotiated between tribes and third parties became effective (25 USCS 396a), and (2) authorized the Secretary generally to promulgate regulations governing mining operations (25 USCS 396d). In 1964, the Indian tribe known as the Navajo Nation permitted a mining company to mine coal on the tribe's lands pursuant to a lease which (1) established a maximum royalty rate of 37.5 cents per ton of coal, and (2) made that figure subject to reasonable adjustment by the Secretary on the 20-year anniversary of the lease and every 10 years thereafter. As the lease's 20-year anniversary approached, the 37.5 cents-per-ton rate yielded for the tribe about 2 percent of gross proceeds, a return that was (1) higher than the minimum established by then-applicable regulations implementing the IMLA, but (2) substantially lower than the rate that had been established by Congress as the minimum permissible royalty for coal mined on federal lands. In 1984, after a request by the chairman of the Navajo tribal council for a rate adjustment, the mining company received from the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs an opinion letter raising the rate to 20 percent of gross proceeds. The company filed an administrative appeal. While the appeal was pending, the company requested the Secretary to postpone decision on the appeal or to rule in the company's favor. Company representatives also met privately with the Secretary during that period. In 1985, the Secretary sent a memorandum to the Interior Department official who was the decisionmaker on the appeal, which memorandum suggested that the official urge the parties to continue their efforts to resolve the matter. Ultimately, the parties agreed to amend the lease to provide for a royalty rate of 12 1/2 percent of monthly gross proceeds, which was the then-customary rate for coal leases on federal and Indian lands. Pursuant to 396a, the Secretary approved the amended lease in 1987. In 1993, the tribe--alleging, among other matters, that the Secretary's approval of the lease amendments constituted a breach of trust--filed an action for damages against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC) pursuant to the Indian Tucker Act (28 USCS 1505), which gave the CFC jurisdiction over some tribal claims. The CFC (1) found that the Secretary had dishonored the Federal Government's general fiduciary duties to the tribe; but (2) granted summary judgment for the United States, on the ground that the tribe had failed to link the asserted breach of duty to any statutory or regulatory obligation which could be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the government's actions (46 Fed Cl 217, 2000 US Claims LEXIS 16).",Public Lands

"Upon an insurer's denial of benefits under the double indemnity provision of a life insurance policy issued in Michigan, the administrator of the estate of the insured, who had been killed in Illinois while residing there, brought a diversity action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to recover double indemnity. The District Court held that under Illinois conflict of laws rules, the law of the situs of the contract (Michigan) applied, and that under such law the insurer was liable only for ordinary benefits. On the administrator's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the insurer argued that the District Court's application and interpretation of Michigan law was correct, and alternatively asserted that under Illinois conflict of laws rules, Illinois law was applicable and that under such law the insurer also was liable only for ordinary benefits. Without deciding which state's substantive law would be applicable under the Illinois conflicts rule, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the insurer was precluded from arguing the applicability of Illinois substantive law because it had not cross-appealed from the District Court's ruling that Michigan law applied (524 F2d 376).",Domestic Commerce

"After a union election in 1977, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certified a union as the collective bargaining representative of a Massachusetts company's 23 employees. The company and the union negotiated a series of collective bargaining agreements, but when one such agreement expired in 1988, the employees went on strike. After continued negotiations, the company presented the union with a complete contract proposal. The union telegraphed acceptance of the outstanding offer, but on the next day, the company expressed doubt that a majority of the bargaining unit's employees supported the union, and for that reason the company disavowed the collective bargaining agreement and denied any duty to continue negotiating. The company traced its doubt to knowledge acquired before the union had accepted the contract offer, including the facts that (1) 9 employees had crossed the picket line; (2) 13 employees had given the company signed forms indicating their resignation from the Union; and (3) 16 employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the union. The NLRB's general counsel issued an administrative complaint charging the company with violation of 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 158(a)(1) and 158(a)(5)), which make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to (1) interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of collective bargaining rights; and (2) refuse to bargain collectively. An administrative law judge concluded that a contract existed between the parties and that the company's withdrawal from the contract violated 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5); the NLRB, in affirming, (1) treated as irrelevant the company's claim of good-faith doubt about the union's majority status, and (2) ordered the company to reduce to writing, sign, and implement the contract on the union's request (303 NLRB 562). However, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined enforcement of the order, on the ground that the NLRB had not adequately explained its refusal to consider the company's defense of good-faith doubt (980 F2d 804). On remand, the NLRB issued a supplemental opinion to justify its position (317 NLRB 364), and the Court of Appeals subsequently enforced the NLRB's order as resting on a reasonable policy choice (60 F3d 24).",Labor

Subsequently, before sentencing and the District Court's decision whether to accept the plea agreement, the accused sought to withdraw the guilty plea. The District Court (1) expressed the view that the accused had not shown a ""fair and just reason"" for withdrawal of the guilty plea, as required under Rule 32(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for withdrawal before sentence was imposed; and (2) therefore refused to allow withdrawal of the accused's guilty plea. The District Court then accepted the plea agreement, entered judgment, and sentenced the accused. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in reversing, expressed the view that if a court deferred acceptance of a plea or plea agreement, the accused could withdraw the plea for any or no reason until the court accepted both the plea and the agreement (92 F.3d 779).",Law and Crime

A substantial part of the cost of the $ 49 million in benefits paid by the state was ultimately imposed upon the four companies, since New York's unemployment insurance system is financed primarily by employer contributions based on the benefits paid to former employees of each employer in past years. The four companies brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the New York law authorizing the payment of unemployment compensation benefits to strikers conflicted with federal law. The District Court, concluding that the availability of unemployment compensation was a substantial factor in a worker's decision regarding a strike and had a measurable impact on the progress of a strike, held that the payment of unemployment compensation to strikers conflicted with the policy of free collective bargaining established in federal labor laws and violated the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (Art VI, cl 2) (434 F Supp 810). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed on appeal, holding that although the New York unemployment compensation law conflicted with federal labor policy, such conflict was one which Congress had decided to tolerate in view of the legislative histories of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 151 et seq.) and Title IX of the Social Security Act (26 USCS 3301 et seq., 42 USCS 501 et seq. and 1101 et seq.)

"Prior to Congress' enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (PL 104-104, 110 Stat 56), states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local telephone market to a local exchange carrier (LEC), which owned the various forms of equipment that constituted a local exchange network. The 1996 Act ended such state-granted monopolies and subjected incumbent LECs to various duties--including the obligation under 47 USCS 251(c) to share networks with competitors--that were intended to facilitate market entry. Under 251(c), a requesting carrier was permitted to obtain access to an incumbent's network by various means, such as (1) leasing elements of the incumbent's network ""on an unbundled basis,"" or (2) interconnecting the requesting carrier's own facilities with the incumbent's network. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules implementing the 1996 Act's local-competition provisions, several incumbent LECs and state commissions challenged some of these rules by filing petitions for review which were consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Court of Appeals concluded, among other matters, that (1) the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding (a) pricing ( 47 CFR 51.503 and 51.505), (b) state review of pre-existing interconnection agreements between incumbent LECs and other carriers ( 47 CFR 51.303), and (c) rural exemptions ( 47 CFR 51.405); (2) with respect to the FCC's primary ""unbundling"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.319), the FCC--in specifying the network elements available to requesting carriers--reasonably implemented the requirement of 47 USCS 251(d)(2) that the FCC consider whether access to proprietary elements was ""necessary"" and whether lack of access to nonproprietary elements would ""impair"" an entrant's ability to provide local service; (3) the FCC's rule forbidding incumbent LECs to separate already-combined network elements before leasing them to competitors ( 47 CFR 51.315(b)) had to be vacated as requiring access to those elements on a bundled rather than an unbundled--that is, physically separated--basis; and (4) the FCC's ""pick and choose"" rule ( 47 CFR 51.809)--enabling a competing LEC to demand access to any individual interconnection, service, or network element arrangement on the same terms and conditions that the incumbent LEC gave anyone else in an agreement approved pursuant to 47 USCS 252, but not obligating the competing LEC to accept the agreement's other provisions--had to be vacated as deterring the ""voluntarily negotiated agreements"" that the 1996 Act favored (120 F3d 753, 1997 US App LEXIS 18183). In a separate opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the FCC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate rules regarding dialing parity, that is, an arrangement enabling a new entrant's customers to make calls without having to dial an access code ( 47 CFR 51.205-51.215) (124 F3d 934, 1997 US App LEXIS 22343).",Technology
"The lower appellate court found that the state statute of conviction covered aiding and abetting a theft, which was outside the generic definition of theft and thus was beyond the scope of the federal immigration statutes for purposes of removal. The alien argued that the state rendered an aider and abettor criminally responsible not only for the crime he intended, but also for any crime that naturally and probably resulted from the intended crime, and thus the state criminalized conduct other than generic theft. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the term ""theft offense"" in ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 1101(a)(43)(G) included the crime of aiding and abetting a theft offense, since every state and federal jurisdiction abrogated the distinction between principals and aiders and abettors and thus aiding and abetting was within the definition of generic theft. Further, the state's extension of potential criminal liability to unintended natural and probable consequences of an intended crime did not by itself establish a realistic probability, rather than a theoretical possibility, that the state statute would be applied to conduct outside generic theft.",Immigration

Upon the fulfillment of either of these conditions, the proceedings heretofore had in the two lower courts are vacated.",Technology
"Upon a plea of guilty in a criminal prosecution in a state court, petitioner was sentenced as a second offender, the length of the sentence being based partly on a previous conviction. Upon sentence as a second offender, petitioner had full opportunity, so far as appears, to contest any infirmity in the previous sentence. While serving the second sentence, petitioner applied to the court which had imposed the earlier sentence to vacate the judgment there rendered against him, on the ground of denial of his right to counsel under the Federal Constitution. The state court denied the motion, and its judgment is here affirmed.",Law and Crime
"Under the Bank Merger Act of 1966, which authorizes approval of a merger having anticompetitive effects if it is determined that such effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served, the Comptroller of the Currency approved a merger between the second and fourth largest banks of Nashville, Tennessee. Thereafter, the United States instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, challenging the merger under 7 of the Clayton Act. The District Court upheld the merger on the basis that the merger would not tend substantially to lessen competition and also that any anticompetitive effect would be outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community, finding, inter alia, that the smaller bank had a high percentage of unsound loans, that its rating had been changed from ""satisfactory"" to ""fair,"" and that its problems resulting from unsatisfactory and backward management would be solved by the merger.
