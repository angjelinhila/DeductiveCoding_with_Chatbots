"The Secretary of Labor, to whom the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 USCS 651 et seq.) delegates broad authority for promulgating occupational safety and health standards (defined in 3(8) of the Act (29 USCS 652(8)) as standards which are ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment""), believing that no safe human exposure level can be determined when a cancer-causing toxic material or harmful physical agent is to be regulated in a standard, took the position that under 6(b)(5) of the Act (29 USCS 655(b)(5))--which directs the Secretary, ""in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents,"" to ""set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity""--a standard for such a carcinogenic material or agent had to be such that the level of human exposure to the carcinogen was set at the lowest technologically feasible level that would not impair the viability of industries regulated by the standard. In accordance with such position, the Secretary, upon determining that there was a causal connection between the toxic substance benzene (a rapidly-evaporating, aromatic liquid produced by the petroleum and petrochemical industries for use in manufacturing motor fuels, solvents, detergents, pesticides, and other organic chemicals) and leukemia (a cancer attacking man's white blood cells), promulgated a standard for benzene which reduced the permissible exposure limit on airborne concentrations of benzene from the consensus standard of ten parts benzene per million parts of air to one part benzene per million parts of air, and also restricted dermal contact with solutions containing benzene. Subsequently, on pre-enforcement review pursuant to a provision of the Act governing the judicial review of occupational safety and health standards (29 USCS 655(f)), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the benzene standard was invalid, the Court of Appeals ruling that (1) the Secretary of Labor had exceeded his standard-setting authority because it had not been shown that the benzene exposure limit was ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment,"" as required by 3(8) of the Act, and because 6(b)(5) of the Act did not give the Secretary unbridled discretion to adopt standards designed to create absolutely risk-free workplaces regardless of costs, and (2) the Secretary was under a duty, arising from 3(8) and 6(b)(5) of the Act, to determine whether the expected benefits from the new standard bore a reasonable relationship to the costs that it imposed (581 F2d 493).",Health
"Following repeated mudslides which caused damage to tracks on a branch line operated by a railroad subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the railroad applied to the Commission for, and was eventually granted, a certificate permitting it to abandon the branch line. The only shipper using the line appeared in opposition to the railroad's request, but failed to perfect its filing before the Commission and made no attempt to comply with the judicial review provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCS 10101 et seq.). Instead, while the abandonment request was still pending before the Commission, the shipper filed an action in an Iowa state court seeking damages under Iowa statutes requiring railroads to furnish car service and transportation to all who apply and under Iowa common law for negligent failure to maintain the roadbed and tortious interference with the shipper's contractual relations with its customers. The state trial court dismissed the action, holding that the Interstate Commerce Act wholly preempted state law as to the matters in contention. The Court of Appeals of Iowa reversed, ruling that state abandonment law was not preempted and that the state and federal schemes represented complementary alternative means of relief for injured parties (295 NW2d 467), and the Supreme Court of Iowa denied review.",Transportation

"Upon petition by the city of Colton, California, the Federal Power Commission asserted jurisdiction under 201(b) of the Federal Power Act (16 USC 824(b)) over a public utility company's sales of electric energy generated out of state to the city, largely for resale to customers in the city and its environs. (26 FPC 223, 39 PUR3d 209.) The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside the order on the ground that Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over interstate wholesales of electricity is confined to those transactions which are constitutionally beyond the power of state regulation by reason of the commerce clause, and since the regulation of the interstate wholesales in the instant case by the Public Utilities Commission of California was permissible under the commerce clause, the Federal Power Commission had no jurisdiction.

"A Dallas, Texas, city ordinance restricted the ages of admission to a certain class of dance halls to persons between the ages of 14 and 18, except for parents and guardians of persons inside such a hall and law enforcement and dance hall personnel. The ordinance also limited the hours of operation of such dance halls. The purpose of the ordinance was to provide a place where teenagers could socialize with each other without being subject to the potentially detrimental influences of older teenagers and young adults. The operator of a roller-skating rink in Dallas created such a dance hall by dividing the floor of the rink. On the skating side, no age or hour restrictions were applicable. On the dance hall side, the ordinance's age and hour restrictions were enforced, but admission was otherwise granted to anyone who paid an admission fee. Most of the dance hall patrons were strangers to each other, and the hall served as many as 1,000 customers per night. The operator, contending that the ordinance (1) violated substantive due process and equal protection guaranties under the Federal and Texas Constitutions and (2) unconstitutionally infringed the right of dance hall patrons to associate with persons outside their age bracket, sued in the District Court of Dallas County to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance's age and hour restrictions. The District Court upheld the ordinance on the ground that it was rationally related to the city's legitimate interest in insuring the safety and welfare of children. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Texas, Fifth District, upheld the time restriction, but it struck down the age restriction on the ground that it unduly intruded on the dance hall patrons' right of ""social association"" under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment (744 SW2d 165).",Civil Rights

"A music publisher's agent placed disputed funds in an escrow account and brought an interpleader action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York following a controversy between the publisher and the heirs of the deceased author of a copyrighted song over the division of royalty income generated by sound recordings of the song. The author had originally assigned his entire interest in all renewals of the copyright to the music publisher in exchange for an advance royalty and 50 percent of all net royalties the publisher received for sound recordings. Subsequently the publisher registered a renewal copyright of the song and issued more than 400 licenses to recording companies who made and sold recordings of the song that generated the disputed royalty income. The sound recordings at issue constituted derivative works within the meaning of 17 USCS 304(c)(6)(A), which provides that a derivative work prepared under the authority of a copyright grant before termination of the grant may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination. The author's heirs subsequently terminated the grant to the publisher and demanded that all royalties on the derivative works be remitted to them. The District Court entered judgment for the publisher (543 F Supp 844), concluding that the terms of the agreements that were in effect prior to the termination of the grant governed the record companies' obligation to pay royalties and that under those arrangements the publisher and the author's heirs were each entitled to a 50 percent share in the net royalties. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed (720 F2d 733), holding that the statutory provision at issue preserved only the grants from the publisher to the record companies, and not the grant from the author to the publisher.",Culture
"In 1983, an airline filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, repudiated its collective bargaining agreement with the union that represented the airline's pilots. In response, the pilots called a strike that lasted for more than 2 years. The strike was acrimonious, with incidents of violence and the filing of lawsuits, charges, and countercharges. Although most of the approximately 2,000 pilots originally supported the strike, about 600 of them were working by August 1985, along with about 1,000 replacement workers hired by the airline. In September 1985, the airline announced that it would fill a large number of anticipated vacancies by using a system that allowed pilots to bid for positions. In the past, this system had assigned positions by seniority. Although the union authorized striking pilots to submit bids, the airline announced that all the positions had been awarded to working pilots. On October 31, 1985, the union and the airline reached an agreement to end the strike, dispose of all pending litigation, and reallocate the vacant positions. Under the agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, striking pilots were offered the options of (1) settling all outstanding claims with the airline and participating with nonstriking pilots in the allocation of certain positions, (2) electing not to return to work and receiving severance pay, or (3) retaining their individual claims against the airline and becoming eligible to work only after the reinstatement of all the settling pilots. Pursuant to the settlement, some positions were awarded to returning strikers who chose the first option, while almost a third of the former striking pilots chose the lump-sum severance payment rather than reinstatement. However, several former striking pilots brought a class action in Federal District Court against the union. These pilots alleged, among other things, that the union had breached its duty of fair representation in negotiating and accepting the settlement, in that the settlement arbitrarily discriminated against striking pilots. The District Court granted the union's motion for summary judgment on the alternative grounds that (1) the Bankruptcy Court had approved the settlement, and (2) even if the settlement was merely a private agreement, the union had not breached its duty of fair representation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversing and remanding on appeal, said that (1) the rule that a union breaches its duty of fair representation if the union's actions are either arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith, applies to a union in its negotiating capacity, and (2) a jury could have found that the union had acted arbitrarily and had thus breached its duty of fair representation, because the jury could have found that the settlement had left the striking pilots in a substantially worse position than would have been the case if the union had surrendered to the airline without a settlement (886 F2d 1438).",Labor

"The operator of a bait business in Maine arranged to have a quantity of live baitfish delivered to him from outside the state, violating a Maine statute which prohibited the importation of such fish. A federal grand jury indicted the operator for importing and conspiring to import the fish in violation of 3(a)(2)(A) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 USCS 3372(a)(2)(A)), which makes it a federal crime to import fish or wildlife in violation of state law. The operator moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the state statute violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Art I, 8, cl 3); but a federal magistrate, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, recommended that the motion be denied, finding (1) that the state statute had a legitimate and substantial purpose in preventing the accidental introduction of baitfish parasites or of nonnative fish species, which would have unpredictable effects on native fish populations, and (2) that there were no less discriminatory means of protecting against these threats, as adequate inspection methods were not currently available. Agreeing with those findings, the United States District Court for the District of Maine denied the motion to dismiss (585 F Supp 393). The operator then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the District Court's constitutional holding. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment, holding that the state had not carried its substantial burden of proving that there were no less discriminatory means of achieving its purpose (752 F2d 757).",Law and Crime

"Objection by a holder of bonds of a railroad company to the allowance, in reorganization proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, of a claim of its parent company for moneys advanced for betterments, was first made on presentation of the reorganization plan to the court. The objection was based on an allegation that the parent company had managed the affairs of the subsidiary for its own benefit rather than for that of the subsidiary and its security holders. In support of the allegation, it was pointed out that during the period when the loans were being made by the parent company the subsidiary was paying dividends, most of which went to the parent company. Both the district court and circuit court of appeals concurred in finding that the control of the parent company not only was in good faith and with due regard to its obligations, legal and equitable, to the subsidiary company and its security holders, but also that it was beneficial and advantageous to them.",Law and Crime
"In November 1985, the Ohio legislature enacted a statute which made it a criminal offense for a physician or other person to perform an abortion on an unmarried, unemancipated minor under the age of 18, except under four circumstances. Pursuant to the statute, a physician could perform an abortion on such a minor where either (1) the physician provided at least 24 hours' actual notice of his intention to perform the abortion, in person or by telephone, to (a) one of the minor's parents or her guardian or custodian, or (b) the minor's adult brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent, if the minor and the other relative each filed an affidavit in the juvenile court stating that the minor feared physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse from one of her parents--provided that a physician who could not give actual notice after a reasonable effort could perform the abortion after at least 48 hours' constructive notice by both ordinary and certified mail; (2) the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian consented to the abortion in writing; (3) a juvenile court issued an order authorizing the minor to consent--thus bypassing parental notice or consent--after (a) the minor filed a complaint stating that she was pregnant, unmarried, unemancipated, and under 18 years of age, that she desired to have an abortion without notifying one of her parents, and that either (i) she had sufficient maturity and information to make an intelligent decision whether to have an abortion without notice, (ii) one of her parents had engaged in a pattern of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse against her, or (iii) notice was not in her best interests, (b) a guardian ad litem and an attorney were appointed to represent the minor if she had not retained her own counsel, and (c) the minor proved her allegation of maturity, pattern of abuse, or best interests by clear and convincing evidence at a hearing which the court conducted while preserving the anonymity of the complainant and keeping all papers confidential; or (4) judicial inaction provided constructive authorization for the minor to consent, where either (a) the juvenile court failed (i) to hold its hearing within 5 ""business day[s]"" after the minor filed her complaint, (ii) to render its decision immediately after the conclusion of the hearing, or (iii) to deliver the notice of appeal and record to a state appellate court (the Ohio Court of Appeals) within 4 ""days"" after the minor filed a notice of appeal, or (b) the appellate court failed (i) to docket the appeal upon receipt of the notice of appeal and record, or (ii) to issue a decision within 5 ""days"" after the docketing. With respect to the judicial bypass procedure, the statutory scheme further provided that (1) the minor had to choose among three pleading forms prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio--one of which alleged her maturity only, the second of which alleged her best interests only, and the third of which alleged both her maturity and her best interests; and (2) the minor had to supply the name of one of her parents on the complaint form and, if not represented by counsel, sign the form. In March 1986, days before the effective date of the statute, an action was brought against Ohio in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, in which action the statute's constitutionality was challenged by an Akron, Ohio facility which provided abortions, a physician who performed abortions at the facility, and an unmarried, unemancipated minor woman who sought an abortion at the facility. The District Court issued an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of the statute (633 F Supp 1123).

"After a federal grand jury indicted two defendants for drug-related offenses and conspiracy, the prosecutor successfully sought a superseding indictment expanding the conspiracy charge, presenting in support of that indictment the testimony of two law enforcement agents who were sworn together and testified in tandem before the grand jury. The defendants did not learn about this joint testimony until their trial before the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia had already begun, although they had diligently searched for error and the prosecution apparently had not deliberately concealed the event. They then moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that the simultaneous presence of the two agents had violated Rule 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; but the District Court took the motion under advisement until after the petit jury had returned a guilty verdict, and then denied it, holding that Rule 6(d) had been violated but that the error was harmless as to all counts of the indictment. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded with regard to the conspiracy counts and directed that that portion of the indictment be dismissed, holding that the Rule 6(d) violation invalidated the superseding indictment, but affirmed as to the other counts which had simply been incorporated from the original indictment (735 F2d 136).

"In accordance with their department's directive, police officers who had accompanied an undercover officer to an apartment in the hope of arresting its tenant refrained from conducting an investigation when the undercover officer, the tenant, and others in the apartment were injured in a shooting incident which occurred as the undercover officer entered the apartment. Instead, the officers requested emergency assistance, provided some medical attention, and guarded the premises. Within ten minutes after hearing of a shooting at the apartment, homicide detectives arrived and began a warrantless search of the apartment which lasted four days and involved the officers' close examination, inventorying, and seizure of two to three hundred objects. During the course of their search the officers took photographs, made diagrams, opened drawers, chests, and cupboards. They also emptied clothing pockets, dug bullet fragments out of walls and floors, and pulled up sections of carpet. A few hours after the shooting incident, the undercover officer died. The tenant whose arrest had been sought was taken to the hospital and interrogated by a police official in the presence of a nurse. The official informed the tenant that he was under arrest for the murder of a police officer and gave him the required warnings of his rights. Throughout the course of the interrogation, which lasted nearly four hours, the accused lay in bed with tubes, a catheter, and intravenous feeding devices attached to his body, necessitating that his responses to the official's questions be made in the form of written notes. The interrogation was interrupted only during periods of time when the accused lapsed into unconsciousness, and was continued by the official despite several statements by the accused that he did not want to continue. Subsequently, the accused was tried and convicted in the Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, of murder, assault, and narcotics offenses, notwithstanding his contention that evidence used against him had been unlawfully seized from his apartment without a warrant and that statements which he had made during the interrogation in the hospital, and which had been used at trial to impeach his credibility, were inadmissible because they had not been made voluntarily. The Supreme Court of Arizona reversed the murder and assault convictions on state-law grounds, but affirmed the narcotics convictions, holding that the accused's statements in the hospital were voluntarily and that the warrantless search was permissible, since in its view, a reasonable, warrantless search of the scene of a homicide, or of a serious personal injury with likelihood of death where there is reason to suspect foul play, did not violate the Fourth Amendment where the law enforcement officers were legally on the premises in the first instance, conducted the search for the limited purpose of determining the circumstances of death, and began the search within a reasonable period following the time when the officials first learned of the murder or potential murder (115 Ariz 472, 566 P2d 273).",Law and Crime

Overruling the defendant's objection to the admission of portions of his immunized grand jury testimony other than those portions charged in the indictment against him as being false, the District Court admitted testimony of such nature into evidence on the ground that it was relevant to prove that the defendant had knowingly made the charged false statements. The defendant was found guilty in the District Court, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the defendant's conviction, holding that because the immunized testimony which had been admitted in the District Court did not constitute the ""corpus delicti"" or ""core"" of the defendant's false-swearing indictment, it should not have been admitted (584 F2d 1264).",Law and Crime
"The Secretary of Labor instituted an action against a real estate management company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, seeking an injunction against the company's alleged violations of the wage and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed as to the findings that the management company was an employer and that gross rentals were the proper measure of its gross sales, but reversed as to aggregating the gross rentals of the properties to determine the sales of the company's enterprise, since the building owners shared no common business purpose (444 F2d 609).",Labor
"Both school districts adopted plans whereby, after place of residence and availability of space were considered, school assignments were made on the basis of race to ensure that schools were racially balanced. The U.S. Supreme Court first held that the cases were not moot, even though the plans were not currently being applied to children of the association's members or the student, since it was not absolutely clear that application of the racial guidelines could not reasonably be expected to recur. Further, the Court held that the districts, which did not operate legally segregated schools, denied students equal protection by classifying students by race and relying upon the classification in school assignments. The districts failed to establish a compelling interest in racial diversity since their plans relied on racial classification in a nonindividualized, mechanical way as a decisive factor, and racial imbalance in the schools was not unconstitutional by itself. Further, the minimal effect the classifications actually had on assignments indicated that other means would be effective to achieve the districts' goals and that the use of racial classifications was unnecessary.",Civil Rights

"As part of Oklahoma's probate laws with respect to creditors' claims against a decedent, a nonclaim statute generally barred claims arising upon a contract, where the claims had not been presented to the executor or executrix of a decedent's estate within 2 months of the publication of a specified notice advising creditors of the commencement of probate proceedings. After an Oklahoma decedent died in a hospital, the decedent's widow (1) instituted probate proceedings in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma; (2) had the decedent's will admitted to probate; (3) was named executrix of the estate; and (4) published the required notice to creditors. Meanwhile, the hospital assigned to a subsidiary the hospital's claim for payment of medical expenses of the decedent, but neither the hospital nor the subsidiary filed a claim with the executrix within the statutory 2-month period. When the subsidiary later filed an application for payment of the medical-expense claim, the District Court denied the application, and rejected the subsidiary's argument that, under state law, a claim for the expenses of a last illness was exempt from the general bar of the nonclaim statute. On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, Division IV, initially affirmed the District Court's ruling. On rehearing, the Court of Appeals rejected an additional argument by the subsidiary that the nonclaim statute violated due process by restricting notice to publication alone, and not requiring actual notice to known creditors. On certiorari, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma (1) agreed with the Court of Appeals as to the state-law exemption issue, and (2) expressed the view that the Oklahoma nonclaim statute, and its potential for barring a creditor's claim, (a) did not constitute an adjudicatory proceeding to which the due process requirement of actual notice applied, but (b) was instead a statute of limitations which operated independently of any adjudicatory proceeding, and acted to cut off potential claims against a decedent's estate by the passage of time (733 P2d 396).",Law and Crime

"When the United States Secretary of the Interior offered to sell leases for oil and gas exploration in certain areas off the shore of Alaska, pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 USCS 1331-1356), two Alaska Native villages filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska in which they sought to enjoin the sale, on the grounds (1) that it would adversely affect their aboriginal hunting and fishing rights in those areas, and (2) that the Secretary had failed to comply with 810(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 USCS 3120(a)), which provides special protections for subsistence uses of public lands in Alaska by Alaskan Natives and other rural residents. The District Court denied the villages' motion for a preliminary injunction and granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary, holding that neither the aboriginal rights nor 810(a) was applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding (1) that any aboriginal rights which the villagers might have had in the areas in question had been extinguished by 4(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 USCS 1603(b)), but (2) that 810(a) of ANILCA was applicable to the OCS; and the Court of Appeals remanded to the District Court for consideration of the proper remedy (746 F2d 572). The Secretary accordingly conducted an evaluation and found that execution of the leases, which oil companies had meanwhile purchased, would not significantly restrict subsistence uses of those areas. The villages moved for preliminary injunctions to halt the companies' exploratory activities, but the District Court denied those motions, holding (1) that the Secretary's evaluation was not adequate under 810(a), and (2) that the villages had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits, but (3) that the balance of irreparable harms did not favor a preliminary injunction, since (a) the exploration would not significantly restrict subsistence uses, while (b) delaying exploration would irreparably harm the search for new national energy sources. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded with instructions to enter the preliminary injunctions, holding (1) that irreparable damage is presumed when an agency fails to evaluate thoroughly the environmental impact of a proposed action, and (2) that injunctive relief is the appropriate remedy for a violation of an environmental statute absent rare or unusual circumstances (774 F2d 1414).",Environment
"After the 1990 census, the Texas legislature promulgated a redistricting plan for the state's seats in the United States Congress. The districts established under this plan included (1) District 30, in the Dallas area, with a population which was 50 percent African-American and 17.1 percent Hispanic; (2) District 18, in the Houston area, with a population which was 51 percent African-American and 15 percent Hispanic; and (3) District 29, adjacent to District 18, with a population which was 61 percent Hispanic and 10 percent African-American. All three districts were irregularly shaped. The United States Department of Justice precleared the plan pursuant to 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) (42 USCS 1973c). However, six Texas voters (1) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against various Texas officials; and (2) claimed that many of Texas' 30 congressional districts violated the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment as racial gerrymanders. The United States, some African-American and Hispanic voters, and a league of Latin-Americans intervened. A three-judge District Court declared that Districts 30, 18, and 29 were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment (861 F Supp 1304).",Civil Rights
"A member of a union local executive board was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California of violating 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which makes it a crime for a Communist Party member to serve as a union officer or employee. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the ground that 504 violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. (334 F2d 488.)",Labor
