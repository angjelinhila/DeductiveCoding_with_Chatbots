"The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) set aside 104 million acres of land in Alaska for preservation purposes. Under ANILCA, those lands were placed into ""conservation system units,"" which were defined to include ""any unit in Alaska of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, or a National Forest Monument."" 16 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3102(4). In addition to federal land, over 18 million acres of state, Native Corporation, and private land were also included within the boundaries of those conservation system units. In 2007, John Sturgeon was piloting his hovercraft over a stretch of the Nation River that flows through the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, a conservation system unit in Alaska that is managed by the National Park Service. Alaska law permits the use of hovercraft. National Park Service regulations do not. See 36 CFR ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2.17(e). Park Service rangers approached Sturgeon, informing him that hovercraft were prohibited within the preserve under Park Service regulations. Sturgeon protested that Park Service regulations did not apply because the river was owned by the State of Alaska. The rangers ordered Sturgeon to remove his hovercraft from the preserve, and he complied. Sturgeon later ified suit against the Park Service in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief permitting him to operate his hovercraft within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley. Alaska intervened in support of Sturgeon. The Secretary of the Interior has authority to ""prescribe regulations"" concerning ""boating and other activities on or relating to water located within System units."" 54 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 100751(b). The Park Service's hovercraft regulation was adopted pursuant to Section 100751(b). The hovercraft ban is not limited to Alaska, but instead has effect in federaly managed preservation areas across the country. Section 103(c) of ANJLCA, in contrast, addresses the scope of the Park Service's authority over lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska. The first sentence of Section 103(c) specifies the property included as a portion of those units. It states: ""Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined in this Act) shal be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit."" 16 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3103(c). ANJLCA defines the word 'land"" to include ""lands, waters, and interests therein,"" and the term ""public lands"" to include lands to which the United States has ""title,"" with certain exceptions. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3 102. The second sentence of Section 103(c) concerns the Park Service's authority to regulate ""non-public"" lands in Alaska, which include state, Native Corporation, and private property. It provides: ""No lands which, before, on, or after December 2, 1980, are conveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any private party shal be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units."" ¬¨¬®‚àö√º3103(c). The third sentence of Section 103(c) explains how new lands become part of conservation system units: ""If the State, a Native Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shal become part of the unit, and be administered accordingly."" Ibid. Interpreting Section 103(c) of ANILCA, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Park Service, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in pertinent part. According to the Ninth Circuit, because the hovercraft regulation ""applies to al federal-owned lands and waters administered by [the Park Service] nationwide, as well as al navigable waters lying within national parks,"" the hovercraft ban does not apply ""solely"" within conservation system units in Alaska. 768 F. 3d 1066, 1077. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Park Service therefore has authority to enforce its hovercraft regulation on the Nation River. The Ninth Circuit did not address whether the Nation River counts as ""public land"" for purposes of ANILCA.",Public Lands
"In an attempt to take over X Corporation, Y Corporation bought 13.2 percent of X's common stock at $ 63 per share, but X's stockholders approved a merger with Z Corporation, thereby confronting Y with certain failure of its takeover attempt and with the prospect of being forced to exchange its X shares for Z's stock. Following a plan devised by its general counsel to minimize its liability under 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act for short-swing profits by holders of more than 10 percent of a corporation's stock, Y made two sales of X's stock within 6 months of the purchase, the first sale at $ 68 per share reducing its holdings to 9.96 percent, and the second sale disposing of the remainder at $ 69 per share. Z demanded the profits realized on both sales, whereupon Y sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri for a declaratory judgment as to its liability under 16(b). The District Court held Y liable for the profits realized on both sales (306 F Supp 588), but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed as to the second sale (434 F2d 918).",Law and Crime
"In an action in a Florida state court, the plaintiff, alleging both negligence and unseaworthiness, sought to recover damages from a shipowner for her deceased husband's wrongful death, which allegedly occurred while he was working as a longshoreman aboard a vessel on navigable waters within the state of Florida. The action was removed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and the District Court dismissed the unseaworthiness claims. Upon certification from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Florida Supreme Court held that a Florida wrongful death statute did not allow recovery for unseaworthiness (211 So 2d 161), and upon return of the case from the Florida Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order and rejected the plaintiff's contention that she was entitled to reversal under federal maritime law (409 F2d 32).",Law and Crime

"The purchasers entered into the contracts at much higher than historical rates in response to a dysfunctional market which caused a dramatic increase in the price of electricity, and the purchasers contended that the rates were not just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.S. _ 824 et seq. The sellers argued that the rates were presumptively just and reasonable and the presumption was not rebutted by a showing of serious harm to the public interest. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with the appellate court and held that the just-and-reasonable presumption applied to the subject contracts, as it did to all purchase contracts, and the lack of initial review of the contracts by FERC did not preclude application of the presumption upon a subsequent challenge. Further, the standard justifying modification of the contract rates required serious harm to the public interest, and the standard was not lessened simply because the challenge was brought by the purchasers rather than sellers. However, the remand to FERC was appropriate since there was inadequate consideration of future burden to consumers and possible unlawful market manipulation by the sellers.",Energy
"The City of New York instituted a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, after the Administrator, pursuant to directions from the President, had failed to allot to the states the full amount of the sums authorized under Title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended in 1972 (33 USCS 1251 et seq.), which makes available federal financial assistance for municipal sewers and sewage treatment works upon approval of the municipalities' plans by the Administrator, thereby creating a contractual obligation of the United States for the payment of its contributions. Section 207 of the Act (33 USCS 1287) authorizes appropriations ""not to exceed"" specified amounts for specified fiscal years, and 205(a) of the Act (33 USCS 1285(a)) provides that the ""sums authorized to be appropriated pursuant to 207"" shall be allotted to the states by the Administrator by specified dates. The District Court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (358 F Supp 669), and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, holding that the Act required the Administrator to allot the full sums authorized to be appropriated (161 App DC 114, 494 F2d 1033).",Environment
"After numerous years of litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi had failed to result in a final reapportionment plan for the Mississippi Legislature, the United States Supreme Court, upon a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the District Court to hold a hearing on proposed reapportionment plans, directed the District Court to take steps to develop a permanent reapportionment plan (see 425 US 675, 48 L Ed 2d 295, 96 S Ct 1814). Thereafter, the three-judge District Court, in a series of decrees, reapportioned from multi-member to single-member districts both the Mississippi Senate (see 419 F Supp 1072) and the Mississippi House of Representatives (see 419 F Supp 1089 and 422 F Supp 1014).

"To stimulate a better focusing of all available resources upon the goal of enabling low-income persons to become fully self-sufficient, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2781 et seq.) provides for federally funded community action agencies and programs, defining a ""community action agency"" as a state or political subdivision, or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization designated by a state or political subdivision, which is capable of planning, conducting, administering, and evaluating a community action program (42 USCS 2790(a)). As the result of an accident involving a privately owned car which the employees of such a community action agency had obtained to transport children to and from a recreational outing sponsored by one of the agency's activities, a child injured in the car and his father, alleging that agents of the United States in charge of the outing were negligent in its organization and supervision, brought an action against the United States in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 USCS 1346(b), 2671 et seq.), which limits the tort liability of the federal government to liability for the acts or omissions of federal government employees ( 1346(b)) and which defines government employees to include officers and employees of any federal agency but not any contractor with the United States ( 2671). Granting the government's motion for summary judgment, the District Court held that the community action agency was a contractor with the federal agency established to administer the Economic Opportunity Act, not a corporation acting as an instrumentality or agency of the United States, and that the employees of the community action agency were not federal employees. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that community action agencies were not traditional independent contractors and that the beneficiaries of the Economic Opportunity Act who sustained injury in the course of federally approved programs were not barred from recovery under the Tort Claims Act (509 F2d 197).",Social Welfare
"In a civil antitrust suit brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the United States charged three carriers with violating 1-3 of the Sherman Act (15 USC 1-3) by transactions in which (1) two of the carriers formed the third carrier under an agreement that the third carrier would have the exclusive right to air traffic along the west coast of South America free from competition by the first carrier, and that the first carrier would be free from competition by the third carrier in other areas of South America and between the Canal Zone and the United States; (2) the first carrier and the second carrier conspired to monopolize and monopolized air commerce between the east coast of the United States and the west coast of South America and Buenos Aires; and (3) the first carrier used its 50 percent control of the third carrier to prevent it from securing authority from the Civil Aeronautics Board to extend its route from the Canal Zone to the United States. The trial court dismissed the complaint against the second carrier and the third carrier, holding that none of their respective practices violated the Sherman Act, but held that the first carrier had violated 2 of the Sherman Act by suppressing the third carrier's efforts to extend its route from the Canal Zone to the United States.

"After an undercover investigation into reported solicitation of prostitution and other illicit sexual activities occurring on the premises of an adult bookstore, allegedly with the knowledge of the management, the local district attorney filed a civil action which sought in part to close the premises, invoking a New York statute which defined places of prostitution, lewdness, or assignation as public health nuisances and authorized the closure of such premises for 1 year. The owners of the bookstore moved for summary judgment on the closure claim, contending in part that closing the premises would impermissibly interfere with their First Amendment right to sell books there. The Supreme Court of New York, Special Term, denied the owners' motion, holding that a closure order would not be a prior restraint on constitutionally protected materials and that the owners' bookselling could not be used as a shield for illegal activity. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, affirmed, holding that closure would not be a prior restraint of protected speech, since the statute was being used to enjoin illegal conduct occurring on the premises and not to regulate the content of materials disseminated there (101 App Div 2d 163, 475 NYS2d 173). However, the Court of Appeals of New York modified the Appellate Division's order so as to grant partial summary judgment with regard to the closure claim, holding that closure of the bookstore was an unconstitutional restraint on the owners' First Amendment rights because it was not essential to further the purposes of the statute (65 NY2d 324, 491 NYS2d 307, 480 NE2d 1089).",Civil Rights

"Petitioner Helsinn Healthcare S.A. makes a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting using the chemical palonosetron. While Helsinn was developing its palonosetron product, it entered into two agreements with another company granting that company the right to distribute, promote, market, and sell a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron in the United States. The agreements required that the company keep confidential any proprietary information received under the agreements. Nearly two years later, in January 2003, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application covering a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron. Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 2003 date. Relevant here, Helsinn filed its fourth patent application in 2013. That patent (the '219 patent) covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution and is covered by the Leahy‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®Smith America Invents Act (AIA).

"An employer, which was also the administrator of its employees' welfare benefit plan, combined several of the unprofitable divisions of a subsidiary corporation into a new corporate entity and persuaded many of the employees of those divisions to transfer their benefits to the plan offered by the new entity, assuring the employees that their benefits would remain secure. The employer, however, was aware that the new entity was insolvent from its inception. At the end of its second year, the new entity went into receivership, resulting in the employees' loss of their nonpension benefits. A group of the employees brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking the benefits they would have been owed under their old benefit plan had they not transferred to the new entity's plan. The District Court (1) found that the employer and its subsidiary, acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 USCS 1001 et seq.), had harmed the plan's beneficiaries through deliberate deception; (2) held that the employer and its subsidiary thereby violated an ERISA-imposed fiduciary obligation to administer the benefit plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan; (3) found that 502(a)(3) of ERISA (29 USCS 1132(a)(3)) gave the employees a right to appropriate equitable relief to redress the harm that the deception had caused them individually; and (4) among other remedies, ordered that the subsidiary reinstate its former employees into its own plan, which had continued to provide benefits to employees of the subsidiary's profitable divisions.

"The principal question presented by this extensive litigation in state and federal courts concerned the character of the right to take fish under the language of several Indian treaties entered into by the United States and various tribes in 1854 and 1855 (10 Stat 1132, 12 Stat 927, 12 Stat 933, 12 Stat 939, 12 Stat 951, 12 Stat 971) whereby the Indians, in return for their relinquishing their interest in certain lands in what is now the State of Washington, were given, among other things, the ""right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations ... in common with all citizens of the Territory."" The federal litigation began in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in a suit by the United States against the State of Washington seeking an interpretation of the treaties and an injunction requiring the state to protect the Indians' share of anadromous fish runs. The District Court held that the Indians were entitled to a 45 to 50 per cent share of the harvestable fish that would at some point pass through recognized tribal fishing grounds in a defined area of Washington, to be calculated on a river-by-river, run-by-run basis, subject to certain adjustments (384 F Supp 312). With slight modification, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (520 F2d 676), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari (47 L Ed 2d 97). Pursuant to an injunction issued by the District Court, the Fisheries Department of Washington adopted regulations protecting the Indians' treaty rights, but these regulations were challenged by private citizens in suits commenced in Washington state courts. The Supreme Court of Washington ultimately held that the Fisheries Department could not comply with the federal injunction, holding, among other things, that the treaties did not give the Indians a right to a share of the fish runs (88 Wash 2d 677, 565 P2d 1151; 89 Wash 2d 276, 571 P2d 1373).

"The plaintiff in the present action, brought in the United States Court of Claims to recover alleged overpayments of federal income tax, was the owner of controlling stock interests in three corporations, each of which was a franchised General Motors automobile dealer; his positions as president and manager of these corporations were his principal means of livelihood. The issue was whether his legal expenses--in contesting, in divorce proceedings instituted by his wife, her claim that his stock interests were community property--were, as he alleged, deductible from his gross income under 23(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which allows as such deductions ordinary and necessary expenses for the conservation of income-producing property, or, as alleged by the government, not deductible under 24(a)(1), which bars deduction of ""personal"" or ""family"" expenses.

The court concluded only Congress can authorize an appeal by a state in a 1442(a)(1) criminal prosecution, and that it had not done so, and it also rejected the suggestion that 28 USCS 1291, the general federal appeals statute, provided authorization for the state's appeal (608 F2d 1197).",Immigration

"Drug Enforcement Administration agents obtained a court order authorizing the installation and monitoring of a beeper in a can of ether that was to be delivered to a buyer.

"After an adult bookstore located in a borough's commercial zone introduced a coin-operated mechanism which permitted customers to watch a live dancer, usually nude, performing behind a glass panel, complaints were filed against the bookstore operators charging that the exhibition of live dancing violated the borough's zoning ordinance which governed uses permitted in a commercial zone. The bookstore operators were found guilty in a municipal court, and were also found guilty on appeal in the Camden, New Jersey, County Court. In response to the bookstore operators' defense based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the court recognized that live nude dancing was protected by the First Amendment, but ruled that First Amendment guarantees were not involved. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, affirmed the bookstore operators' convictions, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied further review.",Law and Crime

"A group of interstate railroads operating in Arkansas brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, requesting that a three-judge District Court be convened for the purpose of declaring unconstitutional and enjoining the enforcement of two Arkansas statutes which required that train crews consist of certain personnel. The railroads alleged violations of the commerce, due process, and equal protection clauses of the Federal Constitution, and also alleged that the Arkansas laws were pre-empted by a 1963 federal statute which had been enacted for the purpose of settling a nationwide railway labor dispute. Without passing on the other issues, the three-judge court granted the railroads' motion for summary judgment on the basis of their contention of federal pre-emption. (239 F Supp 1.)",Labor
