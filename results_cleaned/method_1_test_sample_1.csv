"The employee contended that the official's denial of any conversations with the contractor, and the employee's allegations of the official's misconduct outside the scope of his employment, precluded application of the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act). Thus, the employee argued that the official was not immune from suit and that substitution of the United States for the official and removal to federal court were not required. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the scope-of-employment certification was statutorily conclusive, and thus, the Westfall Act applied, unless and until it was determined as a matter of fact that the official engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment. The government's certification that the official acted within the scope of his employment and removal of the action to federal court were not controlled by the employee's allegations, and immunity under the Westfall Act encompassed the official being on duty at the time and place of the incident alleged in the employee's complaint, even though the official denied that the incident occurred.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal concepts related to employee rights, lawsuits, court decisions, and interpretations of the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, also known as the Westfall Act. These issues are typically dealt with in a legal setting and can involve potential crimes, legal disputes, and judicial rulings, all of which fall under the 'Law and Crime' classification."
"While 151 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USCS 151) grants the Federal Communications Commission authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, 152(b) of the Act (47 USCS 152(b)) expressly denies the Commission jurisdiction with respect to intrastate communications service. An association of regulatory utility commissioners petitioned the Commission for clarification of a 1981 Commission order regarding the depreciation of inside wiring. The Commission eventually determined (1) that 220 of the Act (47 USCS 220), dealing expressly with depreciation, operated automatically to pre-empt inconsistent state action where the Commission had prescribed depreciation rates for a carrier, or, alternatively, (2) that federal displacement of state regulations was justified under the Act in this situation, to avoid frustration of validly adopted federal policies. Upon appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding (1) that the authority to pre-empt state practices was statutorily entrusted to the Commission, and (2) that the regulations at issue were reasonably designed to insure that federal objectives would not be frustrated (737 F2d 388). The Court of Appeals did not reach the question as to whether 220 had an automatic pre-emption effect.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it predominantly discusses legal issues and proceedings related to the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Communications Commission's powers, pre-emption of state practices, and a ruling from The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The text does not discuss any other topics related to the remaining classes, making 'Law and Crime' the most appropriate classification."
"Petitioners are primarily nonprofit organizations that provide health insurance to their employees. Federal regulations require petitioners to cover certain contraceptives as part of their health plans, unless petitioners submit a form either to their insurer or to the Federal Government, stating that they object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage. Petitioners allege that submitting this notice substantially burdens the exercise of their religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º2000bb et seq. Following oral argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties addressing ""whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners' employees, through petitioners' insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners."" Post, p. Both petitioners and the Government now confirm that such an option is feasible. Petitioners have clarified that their religious exercise is not infringed where they ""need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception,"" even if their employees receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company. Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 4. The Government has confirmed that the challenged procedures ""for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court's order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage.""",Civil Rights,Health,"The text discusses a case related to religious freedom and healthcare rights, specifically concerning the requirement for health insurance provided by organizations to cover contraceptives and the process of objecting to this on religious grounds. These subjects fall under the domain of 'Civil Rights' as they involve issues associated with individual freedom, religious rights, and employee rights to healthcare. Therefore, the text has been classified under 'Civil Rights'. Furthermore, it also discusses legislation and possible violations, which is also a significant aspect of 'Civil Rights'."
"The appellant, after being hired as a substitute classroom teacher in a Florida county school system, was later dismissed for refusing to sign a statutory loyalty oath of five clauses required of all Florida public employees. An action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the loyalty oath upon which the appellant's employment was conditioned. The three-judge District Court declared three of the five clauses contained in the oath to be unconstitutional, but upheld the remaining clauses which required each public employee to swear or affirm (1) ""that I will support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida,"" and (2) ""that I do not believe in the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence."" (305 F Supp 445.)",Law and Crime,Civil Rights,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal matters related to an individual's employment, the issue of a state-imposed loyalty oath, and a challenge to its constitutionality in a U.S. District court. The text elaborates on the court's ruling on the constitutionality of different clauses of that oath. Therefore, the reference to laws, court decision, and constitution indicates the relevance to the 'Law and Crime' classification."
"The issue in the instant cases was whether the ""establishment"" clause of the First Amendment was violated by a Pennsylvania statute, or a rule of the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City adopted pursuant to statutory authority, requiring the reading, without comment, at the opening of each school day of verses from the Bible and the recitation of the Lord's Prayer by the students in unison, these exercises being prescribed as part of the curricular activities of students who are required by law to attend school, and held in the school buildings under the supervision and participation of teachers employed in those schools.",Civil Rights,Civil Rights,"The text was classified as 'Civil Rights' because it discusses a potential violation of the First Amendment - specifically, the ""establishment"" clause. This clause prevents the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion. The scenario described in the description—requiring schoolchildren to read verses from the Bible and recite a prayer—raises questions about the separation of church and state, a key civil rights issue."
"In a companion case to Textile Workers Union of America v Lincoln Mills of Alabama, supra, p. 972, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (233 F2d 104), affirming a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maine (131 F Supp 767), granting, in an action by a labor union, specific performance of a grievance arbitration provision in a collective bargaining contract between the union and an employer. Five members of the Court, in an opinion by Douglas, J., rested the affirmance on the grounds stated in the majority opinion in the Textile Workers Union Case, and held, further, that in an action under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to compel arbitration, an order granting the relief sought is appealable.",Labor,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Labor' because it discusses a labor union's dispute resolution case in relation to a collective bargaining contract, and references the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. All these elements are related to labor law and workers' rights, and therefore the text falls under the 'Labor' category."
"The Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC) is an Arkansas state agency owning and operating a network of noncommercial television stations. In 1992, AETC's staff planned a televised debate among candidates for Arkansas' Third Congressional District. Because of time constraints, the staff decided to limit participation in the debate to the major party candidates or any other candidate who had strong popular support. An independent candidate who was certified as qualified to appear on the ballot for the seat in question requested permission to participate in the debate. AETC's executive director, in denying the request, asserted that AETC had made a bona fide journalistic judgment that the viewers would be best served by limiting the debate to the two major-party candidates who had already been invited. In a suit filed against AETC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, the independent candidate (1) claimed, among other matters, that he was entitled to participate in the debate under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment; and (2) sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the debate took place without the independent candidate's participation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in reversing the District Court's judgment in pertinent part, (1) concluded that the First Amendment claim was sufficient to survive a motion for dismissal, (2) held that AETC was required to have a legitimate reason to exclude the independent candidate strong enough to survive First Amendment scrutiny, and (3) remanded the case for further proceedings (22 F3d 1423, 1994 US App LEXIS 8984, cert denied 513 US 995, 130 L Ed 2d 409, 115 S Ct 500). On remand, (1) the District Court determined that the debate was a nonpublic forum, (2) the jury found that AETC's decision to exclude the independent candidate had not been influenced by political pressure or disagreement with his views, and (3) judgment was entered for AETC. The Court of Appeals, in reversing, expressed the view that the debate was a public forum and that AETC's assessment of the independent candidate's ""political viability"" was not a compelling or narrowly tailored reason for excluding him from the debate (93 F3d 497, 1996 US App LEXIS 21152).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' since it primarily discusses a legal dispute involving the Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC). A lawsuit was filed against the AETC by an independent candidate who was denied the opportunity to participate in a televised debate. The issue was taken to both the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Various legal decisions, judgments, appeals, and the application of the First Amendment law are all discussed in the text. This significant emphasis on legal processes and constitutional law issues aligns the text with the 'Law and Crime' category."
"This case concerns an action brought by an Illinois public school teacher against its employer, the board of education, pursuant to U.S. Code Section 1983. More specifically, in final analysis this is a breach of contract case in which both the district court and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a two to one decision agreed that the public school teacher had a property right protected by the United States Constitution to continued employment, which was deprived of him when the board of education did not renew his probationary contract and did not provide to him reasons for nonrenewal, ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á[*2]‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√á nor a hearing prior to that termination.",Education,Education,"The text was classified as 'Education' because it primarily discusses issues related to the public education system, specifically focusing on a public school teacher's contractual dispute with the board of education. The case involves the teacher's right to continued employment within the school system, a topic that falls under the category of Education."
"These cases presented the question whether enforcement of summonses served by the Internal Revenue Service on taxpayers' attorneys in investigations of possible civil or criminal liability under the federal income tax laws--which summonses directed the attorneys to produce relevant documents of the taxpayers' accountants that had been given to the attorneys by the taxpayers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice in the tax investigations--violated the taxpayers' Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In case No. 74-18, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted enforcement of the summons (352 F Supp 731), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the taxpayers there involved had never acquired a possessory interest in the documents, and that the documents were not immune in the hands of their attorney (500 F2d 683). In case No. 74-611, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted enforcement of the summons against the taxpayer's attorney (enforcement also being granted as to a summons that had been served on the taxpayer's accountant), but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed in pertinent part, holding that under the Fifth Amendment, the documents would have been privileged if production had been sought from the taxpayer while he retained possession of the documents, and that in light of the confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship, the taxpayer retained constructive possession of the evidence and thus retained Fifth Amendment protection (499 F2d 444).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal cases involving taxpayers, attorneys, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and various district and appeal courts. It delves into issues revolving around enforcement of summonses, possible civil or criminal liability under federal income tax laws, and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. These elements are all related to legal proceedings and criminal law."
"These two consolidated cases presented the question whether the open fields doctrine permits police officers to enter and search marijuana fields without a warrant where the fields are secluded and contain no-trespassing signs. In the first case (No. 82-15) the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky suppressed evidence of the discovery of the marijuana fields on the ground that the defendant had a reasonable expectation that the fields would remain private. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the suppression order (657 F2d 85). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed, holding that the open fields doctrine permitted the search (686 F2d 356). In the second case (No. 82-1273), a Maine trial court granted the defendant's motion to suppress the fruits of the search, holding that the open fields doctrine did not apply. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed (453 A2d 489).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it deals with legal cases concerning police searches, which are criminal justice issues. It mentions court cases, rulings, and legal doctrines like the open fields doctrine, details about suppression of evidence, and mentions of different court levels like district courts, Court of Appeals, and Supreme Judicial Court. All these elements are indicative of issues related to law enforcement, judicial proceedings, legal doctrines, and crime, placing it firmly within the 'Law and Crime' category."
"In an action by a mother for the wrongful death of her illegitimate son, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Louisiana's wrongful death statute, while authorizing actions by mothers of legitimate children, did not authorize actions by mothers of illegitimate children. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting the claim that the mother was denied equal protection of the laws (379 F2d 545).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it involves a case ruled by United States District Court, and the subject of the appeal was a legal matter, specifically related to a wrongful death statute. This classification is related to legal rules, decisions and their consequences, and criminal actions, all of which are typically included in the 'Law and Crime' category. The issues of court judgments, equal protection of the laws, and statutory interpretations are main themes in this category."
"The United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the petitioners to appear before a grand jury and to answer its questions under a grant of immunity. The immunity was based upon a provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 stating that neither the compelled testimony nor any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony could be used against the witness. Notwithstanding the grant of immunity, the petitioners refused to answer the grand jury's questions and were found in contempt. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (440 F2d 954), rejecting the petitioners' contention that it violated their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination to compel them to testify without granting them transactional immunity from prosecution for any offense to which the compelled testimony might relate.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal issues related to court proceedings, grand jury, contempt of court, witness immunity as per the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. These topics all fall under the domain of law enforcement and the criminal justice system, making 'Law and Crime' the relevant category."
"The tribe contended that the Government acted as a fiduciary on behalf of the tribe and was thus precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against the tribe with regard to matters concerning management of the tribal trust. The U.S. Supreme Court held, however, that the common-law fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege did not apply to the general trust relationship between the Government and the tribe. Although the Government's management of the tribal trust bore some resemblance to a private trust, the Government's trust obligations to the tribe were established and governed by statute rather than the common law, and the Government acted pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law rather than as a private trustee. Further, the tribe was not the real client since the Government did not use trust funds to obtain the legal advice, the Government sought advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a private trustee, and the advice could be obtained to balance competing interests. Also, the Government's trust responsibilities were explicitly delineated by statute and did not include the common-law disclosure sought by the tribe.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it involves a legal dispute between a tribe and the Government regarding the attorney-client privilege, trust management, common-law rules, and statutory obligations. The text also discusses concepts such as fiduciary duties and the different legal capacities in which the Government can act, which all fall under the domain of law. Furthermore, it mentions the judgement from U.S. Supreme Court, which is the highest federal court in the country, indicating the crime aspect of the classification. Thus, the contents and context of the text align it more with 'Law and Crime' than with any of the other given classes."
"The copyright-clause portion of the Federal Constitution's copyright and patent clause (Art I, 8, cl 8) grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings. In 1998, Congress, in the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), amended 17 USCS 302 and 304 to generally increase the duration of both existing and future copyrights from (1) the time of the work's creation until 50 years after the author's death, to (2) the time of the work's creation until 70 years after the author's death. Some individuals and businesses whose products or services built on copyrighted works that had gone into the public domain brought against the Attorney General of the United States an action seeking a determination that the CTEA's extension (1) of existing copyrights violated the ""limited"" times prescription of the Constitution's copyright clause, and (2) of existing and future copyrights violated the free speech guarantee of the Constitution's First Amendment. After the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a judgment on the pleadings for the Attorney General (74 F Supp 2d 1), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, affirming, concluded that the CTEA's increased copyright term (1) was limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit within Congress' discretion; and (2) did not impermissibly restrict free speech (345 US App DC 89, 239 F3d 372). The Court of Appeals subsequently denied rehearing and rehearing en banc (347 US App DC 121, 255 F3d 849).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses legal matters related to copyright laws, constitutional clauses, actions brought against the Attorney General of the United States, and decisions of district and appellate courts. The content revolves around a legal dispute over the extension of copyright terms, which falls under the domain of law. It also discusses the potential violation of constitutional rights, which can be classified under criminal law. Therefore, the primary theme of the text aligns with 'Law and Crime'."
"The petitioners were members of a union which had established a rule authorizing fines against members who exceeded specified ceilings for daily pay for piecework production. After the petitioners had exceeded these ceilings, the union imposed fines on them and brought suit in the state courts to collect such fines. The petitioners initiated charges before the National Labor Relations Board, contending that the enforcement of the union's rule through the collection of fines violated 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act by restraining or coercing the petitioners in the exercise of their right to refrain from engaging in concerted activities. The Board rejected this contention and dismissed the charges (145 NLRB 1097), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, denying a petition for review, upheld the Board's decision (393 F2d 49).",Labor,Labor,"The text was classified as 'Labor' because it discusses issues related to labor unions, piecework production, member fines, and the National Labor Relations Act. These elements are directly related to the area of labor law and workers' rights, providing sufficient context to categorize the information under the topic 'Labor'. Labor typically refers to issues surrounding the work force, working conditions, workers’ rights and similar themes."
"Petitioner, convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, on each of 15 counts of an indictment charging narcotics violations, was given consecutive sentences of 20 months to 5 years on three of the counts, and sentences of the same duration on the remaining counts, the latter sentences to run concurrently with the consecutive sentences; the District Court did not specify with which of the consecutive sentences the remaining sentences were to run concurrently. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the conviction without passing on the validity of the consecutive sentences, finding that the record supported at least 5 of the concurrent sentences and therefore supported the aggregate sentence. (100 App DC 396, 246 F2d 677.)",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text discusses a legal case involving a person (the petitioner) who has been convicted on multiple counts for narcotics violations -- a crime -- in the United States District Court. The narrative further details about the sentences applied on the petitioner on these counts and information about appeal. Thus, it directly pertains to the legal process and criminal activity, therefore, it is classified under 'Law and Crime'."
"Under 21 USCS 841(b)(1), certain mandatory minimum sentences are imposed for trafficking in controlled substances, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), based on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance involved. In 1988, an individual was arrested for selling 11,456 doses of LSD on blotter paper. The combined weight of the LSD and the paper was 109.51 grams. Following a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the accused was convicted on two LSD-related counts. At the time of the accused's initial sentencing, 2D1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (18 USCS Appx) provided that the determinative amount for purposes of sentencing was the whole weight of the blotter paper containing the LSD. The accused was sentenced pursuant to 21 USCS 841(b)(1)(A)(v), which specified a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence where the total weight of the LSD and blotter paper involved exceeded 10 grams. In 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission retroactively revised 2D1.1 to provide that each dose of LSD on a carrier medium was to be given a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams. Thereafter, the accused filed a motion to modify his sentence on the ground that the weight of the LSD attributable to him under 2D1.1 as amended was 4.58 grams, for which amount the applicable sentencing range was 70 to 87 months. However, the District Court ruled that, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Chapman v United States (1991) 500 US 453, 114 L Ed 2d 524, 111 S Ct 1919, the blotter paper must be weighed in determining whether an accused crossed the 10-gram threshold for the mandatory minimum sentence imposed under 841(b)(1)(A)(v), notwithstanding the sentencing range under 2 D1.1 (846 F Supp 1362). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed (46 F3d 1405).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses matters related to crime, specifically drug trafficking, and the legal proceedings related to it. It delves into details about the sentencing guidelines applied to trafficking in controlled substances and refers to relevant laws and court rulings in this regard. Terms and phrases like ""mandatory minimum sentences,"" ""trafficking in controlled substances,"" ""guilty plea,"" ""convicted,"" ""sentencing,"" and ""United States Supreme Court's decision"" also suggest a legal and crime-related context."
"A method employed in 1969 for selecting job applicants for positions with a California county's fire department had a disparate impact on the hiring of blacks and Mexican-Americans. The county, voluntarily in 1971, developed new procedures for screening job applicants, such new procedures involving a written examination graded on a pass-fail basis, the selection of 500 of the passing applicants at random for oral interviews and physical agility tests, and the ranking of passing applicants on an eligibility list in terms of the results of the physical agility tests and oral interviews. In 1972 the written test implementing the 1971 procedures was given, but before random selections could be made, an action was brought in a California state court against the county alleging that the random selection process violated provisions of the county charter and civil service regulations. The state court enjoined the county from using the random selection method pending trial on the merits, and ultimately the county, being unable to devise a nonrandom method of screening job applicants and lacking the resources to interview all of the applicants who had passed the 1972 examination, stopped hiring. When vacancies in the fire department increased and manpower needs became critical, the county's Department of Personnel proposed to expedite the hiring of sufficient firefighters to meet immediate urgent requirements by interviewing the top 544 scorers on the 1972 written test, of whom 492 were white, 10 black, and 33 Mexican-American. Although such plan was abandoned and not put into effect when minority representatives objected to it, it was challenged as violative of 42 USCS 1981 in an action brought in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the county, its Board of Supervisors, and its Civil Service Commission by a class of all present and future black and Mexican-American applicants for jobs with the county fire department. The District Court, among other things, found that although the defendants had acted without discriminatory intent, 42 USCS 1981 had been violated because the 1972 written examination had not been validated as predictive of job performance, and the court, enjoining all future discrimination, entered a remedial hiring order whereby at least 20% of all new firefighter recruits were required to be black and another 20% were required to be Mexican-American until the percentages of blacks and Mexican-Americans in the fire department was commensurate to their percentages in the county. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the District Court's holding that the 1972 proposal to use an unvalidated civil service examination violated 1981 (566 F2d 1334).",Civil Rights,Civil Rights,"The text was classified as 'Civil Rights' because it discusses an instance of alleged racial discrimination within a county's fire department's hiring process. The content involves minorities including blacks and Mexican-Americans, and their rights to equal employment opportunities. The situation led to legal action under the US Civil Rights Act (42 USCS 1981), which addresses racial discrimination. The discussions about equal opportunity, discrimination, and legislation related to these issues, all fit within the category of 'Civil Rights'."
"In a class action suit filed in an Alabama trial court by an individual, it was alleged that an insurance company had fraudulently encouraged its customers to exchange existing health insurance policies for new policies that provided less coverage for cancer treatment. The trial court (1) appointed the individual as class representative, (2) certified the class under provisions of the Alabama civil procedure rules which did not give class members the right to exclude themselves from the class, and (3) approved a settlement agreement that precluded class members from individually suing the insurance company for fraud based on its insurance policy exchange program. On appeal by class members who objected to the settlement, the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed (676 So 2d 1265). The United States Supreme Court granted the objecting class members' petition for a writ of certiorari on the question whether the certification and settlement of the suit violated the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment on the ground that the objecting class members were not afforded the right to opt out of the class or the settlement (518 US ,     135 L Ed 2d 1128, 117 S Ct 37).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified as 'Law and Crime' because it involves legal processes and concepts such as class action suits, court trials, trial court decisions, civil procedure rules, settlement agreements, appeals, and constitutional amendments. Furthermore, it features details about a dispute between an individual and an insurance company over alleged fraudulent actions, which is related to issues of law and crime."
"An indictment charged the defendant with engaging in the business of accepting wagers without first filing Internal Revenue Service form 11-C, the special return and registration application required by 4412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and without first paying the occupational tax imposed by 4411 of the Code. The indictment further charged that when the defendant did file such a form, he knowingly and wilfully understated the number of employees accepting wagers on his behalf--in violation of 18 USC 1001, the general criminal provision punishing the making of fraudulent statements to the government. In the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that the wagering tax laws that required him to file the special return had been held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. The government did not pursue the charges under 4411 and 4412, but argued that the alleged invalidity of the wagering tax laws was ""largely irrelevant"" to the 1001 charge. The District Court dismissed the indictment, reasoning that the defendant could not be prosecuted for his ""failure to answer the wagering form correctly,"" since his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would have prevented prosecution for ""failure to answer the form in any respect"" (unreported memorandum; 298 F Supp 1260).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal issue related to a criminal case. It details an indictment involving charges related to wagering tax laws, violations of the Internal Revenue Code, and fraudulent statements to the government, as well as a defense based on the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. The mention of the United States District Court and the United States Supreme Court also indicates that this is a legal matter. All these elements point to issues of law and crime."
"Section 9(h) of the amended National Labor Relations Act requires union officers to file noncommunist affidavits with the National Labor Relations Board, denies the benefit of the act to unions whose officers have not filed such affidavits, and makes union officers who have filed false affidavits subject to the criminal penalty provided in 35A of the Criminal Code. The Board, after an administrative investigation and hearing, found that an officer of plaintiff union had filed a false affidavit and that the union membership was aware of this fact.",Labor,Labor,"The text was classified as 'Labor' because it focuses on labor relations, specifically pertaining to union obligations and actions under the National Labor Relations Act. It discusses the legal requirements for union officers and potential penalties for not complying with these laws. So, its content is most related to the labor class. Topics related to union operations, labor laws, and labor rights fall under the 'Labor' classification."
"A father and son were indicted in multiple counts for mail fraud, in connection with insurance claims that were made and that insurers paid for fire damage to a restaurant and a duplex that the father had hired an arsonist to burn. Count 1 charged the father with mail fraud with regard to the restaurant fire, and Counts 2 through 4 charged both defendants with mail fraud related to the duplex fire. They were also charged in Count 5 with conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with a third arson scheme. In Count 6, the son was charged with perjury before the grand jury. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied the defendants' motion for severance, wherein they contended that the charged offenses were misjoined in violation of Rule 8(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. When evidence relating to the restaurant fire was admitted, the trial judge instructed the jury not to consider that evidence against the son, which instruction the court repeated in the final charge, together with an instruction regarding the separate consideration to be given each defendant and each count. The jury returned convictions on all counts. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Counts 2 through 6 were properly joined, but that Count 1 should not have been joined. Holding that the misjoinder was prejudicial per se, the Court of Appeals reversed the defendants' convictions and remanded for new trials. The Court of Appeals also held that there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for mail fraud under Counts 2 through 4, because each mailing was in execution of fraud and was designed to lull the insurer into a false sense of security and postpone investigation (735 F2d 799). The Government's petition for rehearing was denied (741 F2d 1381).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text is classified as 'Law and Crime' because it details a legal case involving criminal charges.

"The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (note following 10 USCS 2687), prescribes a process under which, for each of three rounds of base closings, (1) the Secretary of Defense submits recommendations to an independent Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission; (2) the Commission submits a report, including an assessment of the Secretary's recommendations and the Commission's own recommendations, to the President of the United States; (3) the President decides whether to approve the Commission's recommendations by accepting or rejecting the entire package offered by the Commission; and (4) if the President approves, then the President submits the recommendations along with a certification of approval to Congress, which has a short period to enact a joint resolution of disapproval, or else the recommendations must be carried out. In April 1991, the Secretary recommended the closure or realignment of a number of defense bases, including the closure of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The Commission's subsequent recommendations to the President agreed that the shipyard ought to be closed. The then President approved the Commission's recommendations in July 1991, and the House of Representatives rejected a joint resolution of disapproval. Meanwhile, however, 2 days before the President submitted his certification of approval to Congress, some shipyard employees and their unions, members of Congress, states and state officials, and the city of Philadelphia filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 USCS 701 et seq.) and the 1990 Act, against defendants including the Secretary and the Commission. The plaintiffs (1) included a claim that the Secretary and another official had violated the 1990 Act's procedural requirements in recommending the shipyard's closure; (2) made similar allegations regarding the Commission's recommendations to the President; and (3) sought to enjoin the Secretary from carrying out the President's decision to close the shipyard. The District Court, however, dismissed the complaint on the alternative grounds that (1) the 1990 Act itself precluded judicial review; and (2) the political question doctrine foreclosed judicial intervention (777 F Supp 1226). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in affirming in part and reversing in part, expressed the view that (1) the plaintiffs, although not naming the President as a defendant, were asking for review of a decision by the President; (2) the President's actions had never been considered immune from judicial review solely because they were taken by the President; and (3) certain procedural claims--such as a claim that the Secretary had failed to transmit to the Commission all the information which he had used in making his recommendations, and a claim that the Commission had not held public hearings as required by the 1990 Act--were thus reviewable (971 F2d 936). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of a Supreme Court decision in another case (506 US ____, 121 L Ed 2d 364, 113 S Ct 455). On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision, as the court, although apparently recognizing that review was unavailable under the APA, expressed the view that judging the President's actions for compliance with the 1990 Act was a permitted form of constitutional review (995 F2d 404).",Defense,Defense,"The text was classified as 'Defense' because it focuses on the process and implications of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The discussion revolves around the closure of defense bases, specifically the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and the legal proceedings surrounding this decision.

"Customs officials seized 37 kilograms of marijuana from defendant's gas tank at the international border. A grand jury indicted defendant of unlawfully importing marijuana and of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendant moved to suppress the marijuana. The district court granted the motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. The appellate court held that the Fourth Amendment forbade the fuel tank search absent reasonable suspicion. The Supreme Court found that complex balancing tests to determine what was a ""routine"" search of a vehicle, as opposed to a more ""intrusive"" search of a person, had no place in border searches of vehicles. Searches made at the border were reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occurred at the border. It was difficult to imagine how the search of a gas tank, which should have been solely a repository for fuel, could have been more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment. A gas tank search involved a brief procedure that could have been reversed without damaging the safety or operation of the vehicle. While the interference with a motorist's possessory interest was not insignificant when the United States removed, disassembled, and reassembled his gas tank, it nevertheless was justified by the United States' paramount interest in protecting the border. The United States' authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border included the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicle's fuel tank.",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it discusses a legal issue involving the seizure of illegal substances and its related court proceedings.

"The defendant was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for knowingly filing false claims for federal income tax refunds. The conviction rested in part on evidence introduced over the defendant's objection and consisting of incriminating documents and oral statements obtained from him by an Internal Revenue agent before the criminal investigation had begun, while the defendant was in jail serving a state sentence. Before eliciting this information, the agent did not warn the defendant that any evidence he gave the government could be used against him, that he had a right to remain silent if he desired as well as a right to the presence of counsel, and that if he was unable to afford counsel one would be appointed for him.

"An Oregon prisoner brought an action for punitive damages under 42 USCS 1983 against an Oregon public defender who had represented the prisoner at one of his trials on robbery charges, at which the prisoner was convicted, and against another public defender who had represented the prisoner in an unsuccessful state court appeal from this and at least one other conviction. The prisoner alleged that the public defenders had conspired with various state officials to secure the prisoner's conviction. The United States District Court dismissed the action, holding that public defenders are absolutely immune from liability under 42 USCS 1983.

"Pursuant to its Revised Constitution, which had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, the Tribal Council of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe enacted an ordinance imposing a severance tax on oil and gas production on the tribal land, the tax applying to any oil and natural gas severed, saved, and removed from tribal lands, but not applying to oil and gas consumed by lessees of the Tribe to develop their leases or received by the Tribe as in-kind royalty payments, and the ordinance was approved by the Secretary. Subsequently, several individuals and corporations who, pursuant to long-term leases previously signed with the Tribe, extracted and produced oil and gas from the Tribe's reservation lands and who paid royalties to the Tribe brought actions in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to enjoin enforcement of the tax by either the tribal authorities or the Secretary. The District Court consolidated the cases and permanently enjoined enforcement of the tax, ruling that the Tribe lacked the authority to impose the tax, that only state and local authorities had the power to tax oil and gas production on Indian reservations, and that the tax violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution (Art I, 8, cl 3). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the taxing power is an inherent attribute of tribal sovereignty that had not been divested by any treaty or act of Congress (617 F2d 537).",Law and Crime,Law and Crime,"The text was classified as 'Law and Crime' because it deals with a legal dispute concerning the authority of local tribal government versus federal and state governments, in relation to taxation. Specifically, it outlines a case where the Tribal Council of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe imposed a tax on oil and gas production on tribal land, causing several entities to bring legal actions against this tax claim in a federal court. This ruling was later appealed in the United State Court of Appeals. These elements firmly place this matter within the realm of law and legal issues and, omitting ""crime"", there is the implication of potential legal consequences for a violation."
"The principal asset of a bankrupt estate was an undivided interest in coal lands, operated in part by lessees and producing substantial royalties. More than four months prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, two creditors had obtained judgments against the bankrupt, which constituted first and second liens on the interest in these lands. Subsequently, a plan suggested by the attorney for the trustee and certain general creditors was adopted, whereby in consideration of the secured creditors forbearing to press their claims, the estate was divided into two funds: a real estate fund, and a general fund including royalties, etc. The first fund was to go to the first judgment creditor, the second fund was to be divided pro rata among all creditors.
