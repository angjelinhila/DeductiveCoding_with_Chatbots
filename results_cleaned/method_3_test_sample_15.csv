"In the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, the appellants alleged that New Jersey legislation providing for ""Assistance to Families of the Working Poor"" violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against illegitimate children in the provision of benefits. The legislation limited benefits to only those families which consisted of a household composed of two adults of the opposite sex ceremonially married to each other who had at least one minor child of both, the natural child of one and adopted by the other, or a child adopted by both. A three-judge District Court upheld this legislation on the ground that it was designed to preserve and strengthen family life (349 F Supp 491).",Civil Rights
"A Seventh-Day Adventist was discharged by her employer for her refusal to work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith, and was refused unemployment compensation by the South Carolina Employment Security Commission on the ground that her refusal to work Saturdays, causing other employers to refuse to hire her, disqualified her for failure to accept suitable work. The commission's finding was sustained by the Court of Common Pleas for Spartanburg County. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed on the ground that disqualifying the Seventh-Day Adventist from unemployment compensation did not restrict her religious freedom.

"The plaintiff purchased surplus coal from the War Assets Administration under a contract the construction of which gave rise to a controversy. The War Assets Administration took the view that the purchaser had breached the contract and that it was free to sell the coal to another purchaser. The purchaser's suit against the head of the War Assets Administration for an injunction prohibiting the latter from selling or delivering the coal to any one other than the plaintiff was dismissed by the District Court on the ground, among others, that the court did not have jurisdiction because the suit was one against the United States. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jurisdiction of the court depended on whether or not title to the coal had passed.",Government Operations

"After an individual was killed while doing sandblasting work on a vessel berthed in the navigable waters of the United States, the individual's mother filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the shipbuilding corporation for which the individual's employer had been a subcontractor. This action invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction and alleged that (1) the individual's fatal injuries had been caused by the corporation's negligence, and (2) the mother was entitled to damages under general maritime law. However, the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, as the court expressed the view that general maritime law provided no cause of action for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence (1998 US Dist LEXIS 20374). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in reversing and in ordering a remand, expressed the view that while the United States Supreme Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, such an action was appropriate (210 F3d 209). The Court of Appeals subsequently denied a suggestion for rehearing en banc (215 F3d 420).",Law and Crime

"A group of electric utilities in Pennsylvania planned the construction of seven nuclear power plants and incurred millions of dollars in preliminary construction costs, but subsequently cancelled plans for four of the nuclear plants in response to events which changed the outlook for electric power demand and the desirability of nuclear energy. One of the utilities involved sought permission from the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to amortize its expenditures for the unbuilt plants over a 10-year period; and the PUC, after receiving an investigative report which concluded that the utilities' decisions to begin and to end construction of the plants had both been reasonable and prudent at the time they were made, granted the utility in question a rate increase which would include additional revenue to cover the first amortization payment (57 Pa PUC 1, 51 PUR 4th 198). The Pennsylvania Office of the Consumer Advocate moved for reconsideration of that decision, in the light of a recently enacted state statute which prohibited public utilities from including the cost of construction of a facility in the rate base until the facility was ""used and useful in service to the public""; but the PUC, interpreting this statute as not barring the recovery of such costs through amortization, reaffirmed its rate order (57 Pa PUC 177, 52 PUR 4th 644), and granted a similar rate increase to another utility involved in the plant construction project (58 Pa PUC 305, 60 PUR 4th 593). The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, holding that the PUC had correctly interpreted the statute, affirmed the PUC's order as to the first utility, and affirmed the PUC's order as to the second utility in part and reversed in part on other grounds (90 Pa Cmwlth 98, 494 A2d 58). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed the orders of the Commonwealth Court and remanded the cases to the PUC for further proceedings, as it held that (1) the controlling language of the statute prohibited recovery of the construction costs either by inclusion in the rate base or by amortization, and (2) such a statute did not work a confiscation of utility property without just compensation in violation of the state and federal constitutions (516 Pa 142, 532 A2d 325).",Energy
"Police officers investigating an armed robbery committed by two men, one of whom had been wearing a red running suit, obtained arrest warrants for two suspects, including the accused, and executed one of the warrants at the accused's house. The officers entered the house and arrested the accused when he emerged from the basement. An officer then entered the basement, purportedly to see if any other person was there, and saw a red running suit in plain view. The accused's motion to suppress the running suit was denied, and it was introduced into evidence at his trial. The accused was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon and using a handgun in the commission of a felony. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed the trial court's denial of the accused's suppression motion (72 Md App 562, 531 A2d 1290). The Court of Appeals of Maryland, however, reversed, stating that (1) to justify a protective sweep of a home, the government must show that there is probable cause to believe that a serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger exists, and (2) the prosecution had not satisfied this requirement (314 Md 151, 550 A2d 79).",Law and Crime
"Two cases presented the question of the proper mode of calculating the depreciation allowance, provided for by 23(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, with respect to automobiles used in auto rental and allied services. In No. 141, the taxpayer, an automobile dealer, assigned certain cars to company personnel and rented others, selling these cars upon the receipt of new models, if not sooner; the taxpayer claimed a depreciation allowance calculated on the basis of an estimated 4-year useful life for the cars, with no residual salvage value, and, when he sold the cars, he deducted this depreciation allowance from their initial cost, added the sale price to the figure so arrived at, and paid a capital gains tax on the difference between this total and the initial cost. In No. 143, the taxpayer, engaged in leasing new cars to a U-drive agency, followed a similar practice with respect to cars which he sold when they were 15 months old. In both cases the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied the taxpayers' depreciation claims, on the theory that the useful life of the automobiles was not their total economic life, but only the period they were actually used by the taxpayers in their business, and that the salvage value of the automobiles was not junk value but the resale value at the time of disposal. In No. 141, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in a suit initiated by the taxpayer in order to obtain a refund of the tax that he had paid, decided against the Commissioner (156 F Supp 516), but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.

"Several days after receiving a ""wanted flyer"" from a neighboring police department concerning a person suspected of involvement in an armed robbery, police officers made an investigative stop of the person named in the flyer. The stop was conducted while the suspect was in his automobile, accompanied by a passenger. Upon opening the passenger door, the officer observed the butt of a revolver protruding from underneath the passenger's seat. A search of the car conducted after the passenger's arrest uncovered two additional handguns. The robbery suspect was then arrested and subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury for being a convicted felon in possession of firearms. A motion to suppress the handguns from evidence was denied, the trial court concluding that the stop was proper, and the defendant was convicted as charged after a bench trial. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed (713 F2d 220), concluding that investigative stops are restricted to settings involving the investigation of ongoing crimes, not completed ones such as the robbery at issue, that the flyer was insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed a crime, and that therefore his conviction rested on evidence obtained through an illegal arrest.",Law and Crime

"The Mississippi University for Women, a state-supported school in Alabama, has from its inception limited its enrollment to women. A male registered nurse who did not hold a baccalaureate degree in nursing and had worked as a nursing supervisor in a medical center in the city in which the University is located applied for admission to the University School of Nursing's baccalaureate program. Although he was otherwise qualified, he was denied admission to the School of Nursing solely because of his sex. School officials informed him that he could audit the courses in which he was interested, but could not enroll for credit. He then filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, claiming the single-sex admissions policy of the School of Nursing violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following a hearing, the District Court denied preliminary injunctive relief, concluding that the maintenance of the University as a single-sex school bore a rational relationship to the state's legitimate interest of providing the greatest practical range of educational opportunities for its female student population and stating that the admissions policy was not arbitrary because providing single-sex schools is consistent with the respected, though by no means universally accepted, educational theory that single-sex education affords unique benefits to students. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the policy excluding the male applicant because of his sex denies him equal protection of the laws (646 F2d 1116). On rehearing, the state contended that Congress, in enacting 901(a)(5) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 USCS 1681(a)(5)), expressly had authorized the University to continue its single-sex admissions policy by exempting public undergraduate institutions that traditionally have used single-sex admissions policies from the discrimination prohibition of 901 of Title IX (20 USCS 1681(a)). Through that provision, the state argued, Congress limited the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment by exercising its power under 5 of the Amendment. The Court of Appeals rejected the argument, holding that 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not grant Congress power to authorize states to maintain practices otherwise violative of the Amendment (653 F2d 222).",Civil Rights
"At the trial of a defendant who had been indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on three counts of federal narcotics violations, the jury acquitted him of one count but was unable to reach a verdict on the two remaining counts. The District Court declared a mistrial as to these remaining counts and scheduled a retrial. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and also moved to bar retrial on the ground that a second trial would violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment because evidence sufficient to convict on the remaining counts had not been presented by the government at the first trial. The District Court denied both motions and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the defendant's appeal from the denial of these motions for want of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reasoned that its jurisdiction to review the jeopardy claim depended on the appealability of the ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence, that the ruling on the latter motion was not a final judgment appealable under 28 USCS 1291, that the ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence was not within the collateral order doctrine, and that since the merits of the double jeopardy claim depended entirely on the legal sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant had failed to present a double jeopardy claim which could be reviewed at this point (702 F2d 1079).",Law and Crime

"Respondent student sued petitioner officials of the State of Washington under 42 U.S.C.S. _ 1983, alleging that the State's prohibition of educational assistance for the pursuit of a theology degree violated the student's right to free exercise of religion. Upon the grant of a writ of certiorari, the officials appealed the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held that the prohibition was unconstitutional. The prohibition against using State scholarship funds to pursue a theology degree codified the Washington Constitution's express prohibition against appropriating State funds for religious instruction. The student, who otherwise qualified for State educational assistance, argued that the scholarship program unconstitutionally singled out religion for unfavorable treatment without being narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. The United States Supreme Court held that, while the federal constitution did not preclude the election of religious instruction using government assistance, the State's broader prohibition reflected its substantial interest against the establishment of religion by funding devotional degrees, and the prohibition was not violative of the federal constitution since the exclusion of such funding placed a relatively minor burden on the student. That the State dealt differently with education for the ministry than with education for other callings was not evidence of hostility toward religion, especially since the scholarship program did not prohibit attendance at religious institutions or a curriculum which included devotional theology courses.",Civil Rights

"In January 1985, Hawaii police officers found illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia in a house.

The forfeiture was sought pursuant to 21 USCS 881(a)(7), which generally authorizes the civil forfeiture of property used to commit or facilitate the commission of a drug offense. In an ex parte proceeding, a United States Magistrate Judge found that the Federal Government had established probable cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under 881(a)(7), and a warrant of arrest in rem was issued authorizing seizure of the property. The government effected the seizure without prior notice to the owner or an adversary hearing. Tenants who had been renting the house were permitted to remain on the premises subject to an occupancy agreement, but the government directed the payment of future rents to the United States Marshal. The owner, filing a claim for the property and an answer to the government's complaint, asserted that (1) the seizure had deprived him of his property without due process of law; and (2) the forfeiture action had not been timely commenced and was thus invalid.
