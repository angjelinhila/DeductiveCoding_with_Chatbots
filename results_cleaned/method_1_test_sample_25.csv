"An Illinois corporation installed a boiler system at the Ohio facility of a Delaware corporation. Six years later, the Delaware corporation, claiming that the boiler did not meet contract specifications and had been improperly installed, brought a diversity action against the Illinois corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which action charged the Illinois corporation with breach of contract. The Illinois corporation moved for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by Ohio's 4-year statute of limitations. The Delaware corporation argued that the statutory period had not run, pointing to Ohio statutory provisions which (1) tolled the statute of limitations for any period that a person or corporation is not ""present"" in the state and (2) required that a foreign corporation, in order to be ""present"" in Ohio, must appoint an agent for service of process, which appointment operates as a consent to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts. The Illinois corporation responded (1) that the tolling statute was invalid under the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), or alternatively (2) that the Delaware corporation had been ""present"" in Ohio because it had been continually subject to the ""long arm"" jurisdiction of the Ohio courts. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Illinois corporation, because it found that the tolling statute imposed a constitutionally impermissible burden on interstate commerce. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed (820 F2d 186).",Law and Crime
"A franchised regional dealer of a particular manufacturer's heavy-duty trucks sold those trucks to retail customers by bidding against (1) sellers of other brands of trucks, and (2) sometimes, against the manufacturer's franchised dealers from other regions. The manufacturer decided on a case-by-case basis whether to offer dealers a discount--and, if so, the amount of the discount--off the wholesale price, and the dealers then used the price offered by the manufacturer in preparing their bids to potential customers. The dealers purchased from the manufacturer--whose stated policy, in the atypical case in which a retail customer solicited a bid from more than one of the manufacturer's dealers, was to provide the same discount to each dealer--only those trucks for which the dealers' bids were successful.",Domestic Commerce

"A former patient of a state mental hospital, who throughout his nearly 15 years of confinement in the hospital had repeatedly demanded his release, claiming that he was dangerous to no one, that he was not mentally ill, and that the hospital was not providing treatment for his supposed illness, brought an action under 42 USCS 1983, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, alleging that the hospital superintendent and other members of the hospital staff had intentionally and maliciously deprived him of his constitutional right to liberty. The testimony at trial demonstrated that the former patient posed no danger to others or to himself during the time he had been confined, and also showed that his requests for release had been supported by responsible persons willing to provide any care he might need on release. The superintendent's principal defense was that he had acted in good faith and was therefore immune from any liability for monetary damages. Although rejecting a proposed instruction reflecting the superintendent's contention, the District Court did instruct the jury that monetary damages could not be assessed against the superintendent if he had believed reasonably and in good faith that the patient's continued confinement was proper, and that punitive damages could be awarded only if the superintendent had acted maliciously or wantonly or oppressively. The jury returned a verdict assessing both compensatory and punitive damages against the superintendent and a codefendant, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed (493 F2d 507).",Civil Rights
"Petitioner Kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former employer, respondent (Saint-Gobain), under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act), which provides minimum wage, maximum hour, and overtime pay rules; and which forbids employers ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´to discharge . . . any employee because such employee has filed any complaint‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ alleging a violation of the Act, 29 U.

In a related suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing workrelated protective gear. In this suit Kasten claims that he was discharged because he orally complained to company officials about the timeclocks. The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary judgment, concluding that the Act‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s antiretaliation provision did not cover oral complaints. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.",Labor
"A police investigator, having received information that an individual might be engaged in drug trafficking, asked the regular trash collector to pick up the plastic trash bags which the individual had left on the curb in front of his house and to turn those bags over to the investigator without mixing their contents with garbage from other houses. The collector complied, cleaning his truck bin of other garbage before he collected the bags in question. Without a warrant, the investigator searched through the contents of those bags and found items indicative of narcotics use, which she then used in obtaining a warrant to search the individual's home where quantities of narcotics were found. A subsequent similar trash search produced further evidence supporting a second search of the house. The Superior Court of Orange County, California, however, dismissed charges against the individual and an alleged accomplice arising from these searches on the grounds (1) that under state precedent such a warrantless trash search violates the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and similar provisions of the state constitution, and (2) the police would not have had probable cause to search the home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches. In affirming the Superior Court's decision, the California Court of Appeal stated that, while a recent amendment to the state constitution had barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of state law but not federal law, the state courts were bound by the aforementioned state precedent, holding that the trash search violated federal law, unless and until the United States Supreme Court decided the question differently (182 Cal App 3d 729, 227 Cal Rptr 539).

"The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts issued orders enjoining the Boston Police and Fire Departments from laying off policemen and firefighters in a manner that would reduce the percentage of minority officers below the level which existed when the layoffs in question began. These orders had the effect of partially superseding the operation of Massachusetts' statutory last-hired, first-fired scheme for civil service layoffs. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed (679 F2d 965). After the Court of Appeals' decision, Massachusetts enacted legislation which provided the city with new revenues, required reinstatement of all police and firefighters laid off during the reductions in force, secured these personnel against future layoffs for fiscal reasons, and required the maintenance of minimum staffing levels in the police and fire departments.",Law and Crime
"A stock purchaser failed to comply with the disclosure provisions of 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USCS 78m(d)) when he acquired more than 5 percent of a corporation's outstanding stock. When the purchaser continued to purchase the corporation's stock without complying with the disclosure provisions, the corporation's board chairman wrote to the purchaser and informed him that the purchases were giving rise to numerous rumors and that there seemed to be problems under federal securities laws. The purchaser then stopped placing orders for the corporation's stock, consulted his attorney, and filed a disclosure statement. The corporation then brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging that the purchaser was engaged in a scheme to defraud the corporation and its shareholders in violation of the securities laws, that shareholders who had sold shares without the information required to be disclosed, lacked information material to their decision to sell or hold, and that the corporation was unable to communicate such information to its shareholders and to take such actions as their interest required. The corporation prayed for damages and an injunction prohibiting the purchaser from voting or pledging his stock and from acquiring additional shares and requiring the purchaser to divest himself of the stock he already owned. The purchaser conceded that he had violated the Securities Exchange Act, but contended that the violation was due to a lack of familiarity with the securities laws and that neither the corporation nor its shareholders had been harmed. The District Court found that the corporation had not shown the irreparable harm necessary to support an injunction and entered summary judgment against the corporation (354 F Supp 686). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that harm to the corporation had been shown, and that in any event, the corporation need not show irreparable harm as a prerequisite to obtaining permanent injunctive relief (500 F2d 1011).",Law and Crime
"After an Alabama state court had declared a magazine to be obscene in an in rem action authorized under state law, and after a bookseller, having been informed of the magazine's declared obscenity, sold a copy of the magazine, the bookseller was tried and convicted in an Alabama state prosecution for selling mailable matter known to have been judicially found to be obscene. The bookseller, who had received no notice of the in rem obscenity proceeding and who had not been a party to it, had asserted that he could not be found guilty of the criminal charge unless the jury in his case made its own determination that the magazine was obscene, but the trial court had declined to submit the obscenity issue to the jury, instructing the jurors that they were not to be concerned with any obscenity determination. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Court of Alabama, on certiorari, also affirmed, ruling that the decree in the in rem proceeding conclusively established the obscenity of the magazine (292 Ala 484, 296 So 2d 228).",Law and Crime

The District Court held that the Pennsylvania 6-year statute of limitations governing claims on contracts, replevin, and trespass applied to the 1981 claims, and the District Court found that (1) the employer had discriminated in certain respects, and (2) the unions were also guilty of discriminatory practices (a) in failing to challenge discriminatory discharges of probationary employees, (b) in failing and refusing to assert instances of racial discrimination as grievances, and (c) in tolerating and tacitly encouraging racial harassment (580 F Supp 1114). The court entered injunctive orders against the employer and the unions, reserving damages issues for further proceedings.

"These three cases presented the question as to the proper allocation, for determining an insurance company's right to preferential income tax treatment as a life insurance company, of unearned premium reserves for accident and health insurance policies covered by reinsurance treaties (agreements) between insurance companies. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides that to qualify as a life insurance company, a taxpayer must have life insurance reserves constituting more than 50% of its ""total reserves"" (26 USCS 801(a)), and the term ""total reserves"" is defined as including life insurance reserves, unearned premiums not included in life insurance reserves, and all other insurance reserves required by law (26 USCS 801(c)). In the instant cases, the reinsurance treaties between the taxpayers and other parties assumed two basic forms whereby, under one form, the taxpayer served as reinsurer and the other party was the primary insurer, and under the other form, the taxpayer served as the primary insurer and the other party was the reinsurer, with the other party, in both forms of treaties, holding the unearned premiums and setting up on its books the corresponding unearned premium reserve even though the taxpayer assumed all substantial insurance risks. In each of the cases, the taxpayers and the other parties to the treaties filed annual reports reflecting such premium reserve treatment with state insurance authorities and with the Internal Revenue Service. While the state authorities accepted the reports without criticism, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the nonlife insurance reserves should be attributed to the ""total reserves"" of the taxpayers, thus disqualifying them from preferential tax treatment as life insurance companies. In two of the cases, the taxpayers paid deficiencies assessed by the Commissioner and then brought suits for refunds in the Court of Claims, which held for the taxpayer in each case ( No. 75-1221, 207 Ct Cl 638, 524 F2d 1167; No. 75-1285, 207 Ct Cl 594, 524 F2d 1155). In the third case (No. 75-1260), the taxpayer paid the deficiency assessment and then brought a suit for refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, which held for the taxpayer, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed (514 F2d 675).",Law and Crime
"The Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York applied for federal financial assistance under the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972 (former 20 USCS 1601 et seq., recodified as 20 USCS 3191 et seq. after repeal and re-enactment), the purpose of which is to meet the special needs incident to the elimination of minority group segregation and discrimination among students and faculty in elementary and secondary schools, to encourage the voluntary elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation in schools, and to aid schoolchildren in overcoming the educational disadvantages of minority group isolation. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), however, denied the Board's applications, finding the Board to be ineligible for assistance under 706(d)(1)(B) of the Act (former 20 USCS 1605(d)(1)(B), recodified as 20 USCS 3196(c)(1)(B))--a provision of the Act under which an educational agency is deemed ineligible for federal assistance if it has in effect any practice ""which results in the disdisproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or other personnel from minority groups"" or ""otherwise engage[s] in discrimination ... in the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees""--on the basis of statistical evidence, which the Board did not rebut, showing that there was a pattern of racially disproportionate assignments of minority teachers in the school system in relation to the number of minority students enrolled at the respective schools. The Board then brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the racially disproportionate teacher assignments were the result of provisions of state law, the terms of collective bargaining agreements, licensing requirements for particular teaching positions, a bilingual-instruction consent decree, and changes in student population. The District Court remanded the case to HEW for further consideration on the ground that HEW should have considered the asserted justifications put forth by the Board. HEW, on remand, found that the justifications did not sufficiently rebut the prima facie case of discrimination established by the statistics. Thereafter, the District Court upheld HEW's finding of ineligibility and denied relief, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting the Board's argument that HEW was required to establish that the statistical disparities were the result of purposeful or intentional discrimination in the constitutional sense (584 F2d 576).",Civil Rights

"As a condition of obtaining access to classified information, federal employees in the Executive Branch are required to sign ""nondisclosure agreements"" that (1) detail the employees' obligation of confidentiality, and (2) provide for penalities in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Two such forms--Standard Form 189, devised by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, and Form 4193, devised by the Director of Central Intelligence--forbade employees to reveal classified or ""classifiable"" information to persons unauthorized to receive such information. Section 630 of the Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 1988 (PL 100-202, 101 Stat 1329-432, continued with identical restrictions for fiscal year 1989 in 619 of PL 100-440, 102 Stat 1756), prohibited the expenditure of funds in fiscal year 1988 for the implementation or enforcement of Form 189, Form 4193, or any other form that violated several specified restrictions. Although the Directors took some actions in response to 630, a foreign service association and several members of Congress filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the two Directors and challenged the Directors' use of Forms 189 and 4193, on the ground that the use violated 630. The lawsuit was consolidated with two other cases, which were brought by federal employee organizations, and which included claims that the forms (1) violated 630, and (2) were so vague and overbroad as to inhibit employees' speech in violation of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court (1) assumed that the Executive's actions since the enactment of 630 did not comply with the requirements of 630, on the ground that the actions were not true to the congressional mandates from which the actions derived authority and were likely to be found to be contrary to law upon judicial review; but (2) concluded that 630 unconstitutionally restricted the President's power to fulfill the obligations imposed upon him by his constitutional authority as to national security and his role as to foreign relations; and (3) entered summary judgment in favor of the Directors (688 F Supp 671).",Law and Crime

"An action against the Federal Election Commission and various government officials was instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by various individuals and groups, including federal officeholders, candidates, and political organizations, challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (generally 2 USCS 431 et seq., 18 USCS 591 et seq.) and the provisions of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 9001 et seq.) for public financing of Presidential election campaigns. The principal statutes involved--attacked primarily as violating First Amendment speech and association rights and Fifth Amendment equal protection principles--(a) limit political contributions by individuals or groups to any single candidate for a federal elective office to $ 1,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(1)), limit contributions to any such candidate by political committees to $ 5,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(2)), and impose a $ 25,000 annual limitation on total contributions by any contributor (18 USCS 608(b)(3)); (b) limit independent expenditures by an individual or group advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office to $ 1,000 per year (18 USCS 608(e)(1)), set limits, depending on the office involved, on expenditures by a candidate for federal office during any calendar year (18 USCS 608(a)(1)), and establish limits, depending on the office involved, on overall campaign expenditures by candidates (18 USCS 608(c)); (c) require political committees to report to the Federal Election Commission the names of persons contributing more than $ 10, with the names of those contributing more than $ 100 in a calendar year being subject to public inspection (2 USCS 431 et seq.), and require every person or group (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes independent political contributions or expenditures exceeding $ 100 in a calendar year, other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate, to file a statement with the Commission (2 USCS 434(e)); and (d) provide for the public financing from general revenues of Presidential nominating conventions, general election campaigns, and primary campaigns, with the principal portion of public funds being allocated to ""major"" political parties (parties receiving 25% or more of the vote in the most recent Presidential election) and their candidates (26 USCS 9001 et seq.). The plaintiffs also contended that the method of appointment of members of the Federal Election Commission under 2 USCS 437c(a)(1)--which provides that two of the six voting members are to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate, two are to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two are to be appointed by the President, with all six members being subject to confirmation by the majority of both Houses of Congress--violated the principle of separation of powers as contained in the provisions of the appointments clause of the Constitution (Art II, 2, cl 2) requiring that the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint all officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, unless Congress vests the appointment of such officers in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments. Pursuant to 2 USCS 437h, the District Court certified the constitutional questions to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional attacks on the basic statutory provisions involved (171 App DC 172, 519 F2d 821). To avoid any possible questions as to jurisdiction to hear the challenge to the constitutionality of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, a three-judge District Court sat jointly with the Court of Appeals and adopted the Court of Appeals' opinion on such matter (401 F Supp 1235).",Government Operations
"A black accused, who was charged in a state trial court in Missouri with a robbery that did not involve a gun, objected to the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike two black men from the jury panel. The prosecutor explained that he struck (1) the first juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard; and (2) the second juror because (a) the juror had a mustache and a beard, and (b) the prosecutor feared that the juror, having had a gun pointed at him during a robbery, would believe that a robbery required a gun. The trial court overruled the objection, impaneled the jury, and convicted the accused of robbery. On direct appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals (1) expressed the view that under the decision in Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712--that a state prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from a jury trying a black defendant may be the basis for a claim of purposeful discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment--the circumstances failed to raise the necessary inference of racial discrimination; and (2) affirmed the judgment of the trial court (747 SW2d 772). The accused filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 USCS 2254, asserting a Batson claim. After the District Court denied the claim, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (1) expressed the view that the prosecutor's asserted reasons for striking the first juror were not legitimate race-neutral reasons and that the trial court had erred in finding that striking the juror had not been intentional discrimination, and (2) reversed the judgment of the District Court (25 F3d 679).",Law and Crime

"A patent was sought for a computer system for automatic record keeping of bank checks and deposits, permitting a bank--by using machine readable checks and deposit slips, bearing numerical category codes for various types of expenditures and sources of deposited funds--to furnish a customer with subtotals for each category of transactions conducted through the customer's single bank account. Both a patent examiner and the Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals rejected the patent application on various grounds, including obviousness under 103 of the Patent Act (35 USCS 103), which provides that a patent may not be obtained if the subject matter would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the applicable art. The United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the Board's decision, holding that the patent applicant's system was not obvious under prior art (502 F2d 765).",Technology
