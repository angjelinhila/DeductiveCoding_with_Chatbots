"A railroad employee brought the present suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in a Utah state court to recover damages for personal injury sustained as a result of his employer's negligence. Although disputed, his evidence showed that he was permitted to work at night in subzero temperature to repair a railroad track although his foreman knew that the employee was dressed less warmly than the other members of the crew and that the condition of two of his fingers became abnormal. In assessing the damages for the injuries sustained by the employee--loss of two fingers as a result of frostbite--the jury assessed general damages at $ 20,000 and deducted therefrom $ 10,000 on account of plaintiff's contributory negligence. The Supreme Court of Utah vacated the jury verdict and ordered the entry of judgment for defendant on the ground that plaintiff's own conduct resulted in his injury.

"Upon petition of a labor union for a representation election to determine whether the union would be certified as the bargaining representative of 25 buyers in the purchasing and procurement department at the employer's plant, the National Labor Relations Board held that the buyers constituted an appropriate unit and directed an election (190 NLRB 431), which resulted in the Board's certification of the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for the buyers. The employer's motion for reconsideration of the Board's earlier order was denied by the Board on the ground that the employer had not shown that union organization of its buyers would create a conflict of interest in labor relations (196 NLRB 827). However, the employer refused to bargain with the union and the Board found that the employer was guilty of an unfair labor practice in violation of 8(a)(5) and (1) of the amended National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(a)(5 and 1)) and the Board issued an order compelling the company to bargain with the union (197 NLRB No. 30). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the Board's cross petition for enforcement of this order on the grounds that (1) it was not certain that the Board's decision rested on a factual determination that the buyers were not true ""managerial employees"" rather than on its new, and in the court's view, erroneous holding, that the Board was free to regard all managerial employees as covered by the Act unless their duties met the conflict of interest touchstone and (2) the Board was required to proceed by rulemaking rather than by adjudication in determining the status of the buyers as ""managerial employees"" (475 F2d 485).",Labor

"Two cases presented the question of the proper mode of calculating the depreciation allowance, provided for by 23(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, with respect to automobiles used in auto rental and allied services. In No. 141, the taxpayer, an automobile dealer, assigned certain cars to company personnel and rented others, selling these cars upon the receipt of new models, if not sooner; the taxpayer claimed a depreciation allowance calculated on the basis of an estimated 4-year useful life for the cars, with no residual salvage value, and, when he sold the cars, he deducted this depreciation allowance from their initial cost, added the sale price to the figure so arrived at, and paid a capital gains tax on the difference between this total and the initial cost. In No. 143, the taxpayer, engaged in leasing new cars to a U-drive agency, followed a similar practice with respect to cars which he sold when they were 15 months old. In both cases the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied the taxpayers' depreciation claims, on the theory that the useful life of the automobiles was not their total economic life, but only the period they were actually used by the taxpayers in their business, and that the salvage value of the automobiles was not junk value but the resale value at the time of disposal. In No. 141, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in a suit initiated by the taxpayer in order to obtain a refund of the tax that he had paid, decided against the Commissioner (156 F Supp 516), but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.

"A former executive of a defendant in antitrust litigation was interviewed by Department of Justice attorneys following their promise of use immunity. The executive subsequently appeared before a grand jury investigating price-fixing activities and, pursuant to 18 USCS 6002, was granted formal use immunity for his testimony. Following the criminal indictment of several companies, numerous civil antitrust actions were filed in various United States District Courts and those actions were consolidated for discovery in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court ordered that portions of the immunized government interview and grand-jury testimony of certain witnesses, including that of the executive, be made available to lawyers for the plaintiffs in the actions. Pursuant to a subpoena issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the executive appeared at a deposition in which he, his counsel, and plaintiffs' counsel had copies of his immunized testimony. The executive was questioned with the use of information from the grand jury testimony in a manner in which the executive was finally asked, after a series of questions, if he had ""so testified"" in his immunized interview and grand-jury examination on a number of different circumstances. The executive refused to answer each question, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. When the executive continued to claim his privilege against self-incrimination after the District Court had granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel him to answer the questions, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, exercising the powers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, held him in contempt. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the contempt order, holding that because the questions asked were taken verbatim from or closely tracked the transcript of the executive's grand jury testimony, his answers at the deposition would be derived from the prior immunized testimony and would therefore be unavailable for use in any subsequent criminal prosecution (655 F2d 748). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, holding that under 18 USCS 6002, absent a separate and independent grant of immunity, a deponent's civil deposition testimony that repeats verbatim or closely tracks his prior immunized testimony is not protected (661 F2d 1145).",Law and Crime
"In a Virginia court, an individual was (1) convicted, partly on the basis of the testimony of an alleged confederate, on charges including murder, and (2) sentenced to death. After direct appeals and a state habeas corpus petition proved unsuccessful, the individual filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. This petition asserted, for the first time, that (1) state prosecutors had violated Brady v Maryland (1963) 373 US 83, 10 L Ed 2d 215, 83 S Ct 1194, by failing to disclose a report of a confidential pretrial psychiatric examination of the confederate; (2) the individual's trial had been rendered unfair by a juror's failure to disclose at voir dire that she had formerly been married to a prosecution witness and had been represented in her divorce by one of the prosecutors; and (3) this prosecutor had committed misconduct by failing to reveal his knowledge of the juror's possible bias. The District Court initially granted the petitioner an evidentiary hearing on the latter two claims. However, the District Court vacated that order and dismissed the petition after being directed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to apply 28 USCS 2254(e)(2), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (PL 104-132), which provided that if habeas corpus petitioners ""failed to develop the factual basis"" of their claims in state court proceedings, an evidentiary hearing could not be held unless (1) the claims relied on either a new rule of constitutional law or a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence, and (2) the underlying facts were sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioners guilty. The Court of Appeals, in subsequently affirming the dismissal, expressed the view that (1) 2254(e)(2) would not apply if the petitioner had been diligent in attempting to develop his claims in state court; (2) the petitioner had not been diligent with respect to his claims of nondisclosure of evidence, juror bias, and prosecutorial misconduct; and (3) the petitioner could not satisfy the conditions for excusing a failure to develop claims under 2254(e)(2) (189 F3d 421).",Law and Crime

"In May 1966 the plaintiff brought, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a class action on behalf of himself and all other odd-lot traders on the New York Stock Exchange, charging defendant brokerage firms and defendant Stock Exchange in his complaint with violations of the antitrust and securities laws. The litigation, protracted for 8 years and involving a series of decisions by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, dealt with the complex questions surrounding plaintiff's attempt to maintain his suit as a class action under Federal Civil Procedure Rule 23. Insofar as pertinent, the District Court ultimately decided that (1) individual notice should be mailed to approximately 2000 or more class members who had two or more transactions during the relevant period, and to 5000 members selected at random from the 200 million members who were identifiable, but that notice by publication should be given to the remainder of this class, and (2) before considering the apportionment of the cost of notice, the court should hold a preliminary hearing as to the merits of the plaintiff's case, in which he must make a strong showing of likelihood of success (52 FRD 253); after that hearing was held, the District Court imposed 90 percent of the cost of giving notice on defendants (54 FRD 565). Disapproving these rulings of the District Court, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and ordered the suit dismissed as a class action, one of the judges concurring in the result solely on the ground that the District Court's holding in 54 FRD 565, as stated above, was erroneous (479 F2d 1005, reh and reh en banc den 479 F2d 1020).",Law and Crime
"These two consolidated cases presented the question whether a state criminal trial court is constitutionally compelled to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly. In No. 79-5949, the defendant, prior to his trial in a Kentucky Court, had been identified by one witness at a three-person lineup and by another witness, who was hospitalized, at a showup. At the trial, these witnesses identified the defendant, but were not asked by the prosecutor about the lineup or the showup. Defendant's counsel, however, cross-examined both witnesses at some length about both the lineup and the showup. In No. 79-5951, a rape victim had selected the defendant's picture from police files as the perpetrator of her rape. A police officer testified to this event at the defendant's subsequent trial in a Kentucky Court, as did the victim and her stepfather, and the victim also identified the defendant as the rapist. There was extensive cross-examination. In each case, the Supreme Court of Kentucky found no error in the trial court's refusal to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the identification evidence was admissible, also holding that the identification procedures were not impermissibly suggestive ( No. 79-5949, 565 SW2d 630; No. 79-5951, 550 SW2d 548). The defendants each sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, but that court found no constitutional error. On appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the cases were consolidated and the Court of Appeals, in a single opinion affirmed the judgments of the District Court (608 F2d 247).",Law and Crime

The lessor having failed to make refund, the Area Rent Director brought an action, in the exercise of statutory power to sue any one who collects more than the prescribed maximum, for treble the amount of the excess rentals.

"A union official who allegedly used his control over the union's investments to enrich himself and some coconspirators through kickbacks was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and was convicted under federal labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion provisions. After a sentencing hearing, the District Court determined that the money laundering counts would not be grouped with the other offenses pursuant to 3D1.2 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (18 USCS Appx), which allowed the grouping of ""counts involving substantially the same harm."" As a result, the defendant's offense level was increased by two levels for purposes of the Guidelines, and he was sentenced to 84 months in prison, which sentence was in the middle of the Guidelines' range of 78 to 97 months. The defendant's attorneys did not (1) submit papers or offer extensive oral arguments on the grouping issue in the District Court, or (2) raise this issue on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the conviction and sentence (101 F3d 1183). Subsequently, the defendant, filing a motion in the District Court to correct his sentence under 28 USCS 2255, alleged that the failure of his attorneys to press the grouping issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment, as the defendant argued that (1) absent the allegedly ineffective assistance, his offense level would have been two levels lower, with a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months; and (2) the 84-month sentence that he received was thus an unlawful increase of anywhere between 6 and 21 months. The District Court, in denying the motion, (1) expressed the view that an increase of 6 to 21 months in a defendant's sentence was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of the rule of Strickland v Washington (1984) 466 US 668, 80 L Ed 2d 674, 104 S Ct 2052, under which a defendant, in order to obtain relief under a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, must show that counsel's defective performance prejudiced the defense; and (2) did not decide the issue whether the performance of the defendant's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence. The Court of Appeals, in affirming, expressed the view that even if counsel's performance had been ineffective, the resulting additional 6 to 21 months' sentence did not constitute prejudice (182 F3d 921, reported in full 1999 US App LEXIS 16876).",Law and Crime

At the trial's sentencing phase, the jury found, among other things, the aggravating factor that the accused committed the murder while he was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing from the commission of rape or kidnapping. The Tennessee Supreme Court (1) affirmed the accused's conviction and sentence (743 S.W.2d 141); and (2) eventually, held that the accused's state-court claims for postconviction relief were procedurally barred by state law (911 S.W.2d 705). Subsequently, the accused sought federal habeas corpus relief. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (1) held, after an evidentiary hearing, that the accused had failed to make a showing sufficient for application of the actual-innocence exception to state-law procedural default recognized as to substantive offenses in Schlup v. Delo (1995) 513 U.S. 298, 115 S. Ct. 851, 130 L. Ed. 2d 808, and as to death sentences in Sawyer v. Whitley (1992) 505 U.S. 333, 112 S. Ct. 2514, 120 L.

"These cases presented the issue whether the religion clauses of the First Amendment were violated by state statutes providing state aid to church- related elementary and secondary schools, and to teachers therein, with regard to instruction in secular matters. In Nos. 569 and 570, citizens and taxpayers of Rhode Island brought suit against state officials in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island to enjoin, as repugnant to the religion clauses of the First Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the operation of a Rhode Island statute providing for payment of up to 15-percent annual salary supplements to teachers of secular subjects in nonpublic elementary schools. Under the statute, the teacher was required to be employed in a nonpublic school at which the average per-pupil expenditure on secular education was less than the public school average; the school's financial records were subject to audit by the state; the teacher was required to teach only those subjects offered in the public schools, using teaching materials used in the public schools; and upon applying for a salary supplement, the teacher was required to first agree in writing not to teach a course in religion while receiving salary supplements. After hearing evidence which concerned the nature of secular instruction offered in Roman Catholic schools--only teachers at such schools having applied for benefits under the statute--the three-judge District Court found that the parochial school system was an integral part of the religious mission of the church, and held that the statute violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. (316 F Supp 112.) In No. 89, a similar action against state officials was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by Pennsylvania residents and taxpayers, and associations thereof, challenging the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute providing for state reimbursement of nonpublic elementary and secondary schools for costs of teachers' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in specified secular subjects, but prohibiting reimbursement for any course that contained any subject matter expressing religious teaching or the morals or forms of worship of any sect. Under the Pennsylvania statute, the participating schools were required to maintain prescribed accounting procedures to identify the cost of secular educational service; such accounts were subject to state audit; reimbursement was limited to courses presented in the public schools' curricula; and textbooks and instructional materials were subject to approval by the state. The complaint alleged that church-related schools, which were the principal beneficiaries under the statute, were controlled by religious organizations, had the purpose of propagating a particular religious faith, and conducted their operations to fulfil such purpose.

Upon remand, the Supreme Court of Louisiana again sustained the defendant's conviction under the ordinance, holding that the ordinance, as written, was narrowed to ""fighting words"" uttered to specific persons at a specific time (263 La 809, 269 So 2d 450).",Law and Crime

"Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 158(a)(3)) permits unions and employers to negotiate a union security clause that requires union ""membership"" as a condition of employment for all employees ""on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment."" The United States Supreme Court has (1) interpreted a proviso to this language to mean that the only ""membership"" that a union can require is the payment of fees and dues; and (2) held that unions are allowed to collect and expend funds over the objection of nonmembers only to the extent that such funds are used for collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment activities. A union and an entertainment production company signed a collective bargaining agreement that contained a standard union security clause which--in generally tracking the language of 8(a)(3)--contained a term that interpreted the 30-day grace period provision to begin running with any employment in the motion picture industry. An actress who successfully auditioned for a role in an episode of a television series produced by the company understood from a company representative that pursuant to the security clause, the actress would be required to pay the union fees before she could begin work, because the actress had previously worked in the motion picture industry for more than 30 days. The actress attempted to negotiate an agreement with the union that would have allowed her to pay the union fees after she was paid for her work by the company. When these negotiations failed and the actress had not paid the fees by the day before her part was to be filmed, the company hired a different person to fill the part. In a suit filed against the company and the union in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, the actress alleged, among other matters, that (1) the union had breached the duty of fair representation by negotiating and enforcing a union security clause which did not contain language informing her of her right not to join the union and to pay for only the union's representational activities; and (2) the clause's grace period provision contravened the express language of 8(a)(3). The District Court, in granting summary judgment to the company and the union on all claims, concluded that (1) the union had not breached the duty of fair representation by negotiating the union security clause, and (2) the challenge to the grace period provision was actually an unfair labor practice claim and was thus pre-empted by the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (1996 US Dist LEXIS 12602). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming in part and reversing in part, (1) agreed that (a) the union had not breached the duty of fair representation by negotiating a union security clause that tracked the NLRA language, and (b) the challenge to the grace period provision was not a fair representation claim and thus did not fall within the District Court's jurisdiction; but (2) reversed the grant of summary judgment--and remanded the case for further proceedings--on the claim that the union had arbitrarily or in bad faith breached the duty of fair representation in the enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement (124 F3d 1034, 1997 US App LEXIS 22796).

After two persons engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts had been prosecuted in Federal District Courts for violations of the Eagle Protection and Migratory Bird Treaty Acts in connection with their sales of artifacts which existed before the statutory protection of the Acts came into force and which were partly composed of the feathers of birds protected by the Acts, such persons, along with others engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts, brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the Acts did not forbid the sale of artifacts insofar as the constituent bird parts were obtained prior to the effective date of the statutes, and that if the statutes and the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior did apply to such property, they violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The three-judge District Court, granting the relief sought, held that since the Acts were to be interpreted as not being applicable to pre-existing, legally obtained bird parts, the challenged regulations were void as unauthorized extensions of the Acts, and that such regulations also violated the Fifth Amendment.",Environment
"Appellant Alleghany Corporation, which had registered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, obtained, with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, control of a railroad company not involved in the present proceeding. Hence Alleghany was no longer an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, which excludes any company subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act. Alleghany disposed of its holdings of the railroad stock mentioned above and, without approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission, obtained control of the New York Central Railroad Company.",Transportation
"Section 441a(d)(3) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 USCS 441a(d)(3)) limits the amount of money that the national and state committees of a political party may spend in connection with the general election campaign of a candidate for the Senate or House of Representatives. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee (NRSC), which is a political committee organized specifically to support Republican candidates in elections for the U. S. Senate, is authorized by 441a(h) of the Act (2 USCS 441a(h)) to make contributions to candidates. However, the NRSC is not given authority under 441a(d) of the Act (2 USCS 441a(d)) to make expenditures on behalf of such candidates, and the Federal Election Commission takes the position that the NRSC may not do so on its own account. The Commission has permitted the NRSC to act as the agent of national and state party committees in making expenditures on their behalf. After certain state Republican party committees designated the NRSC as their agent for 441a(d)(3) expenditure purposes, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) filed a complaint with the Commission asserting that the NRSC's agreements with the state committees were contrary to 441a(d)(3). The Commission unanimously dismissed the complaint, and the DSCC then petitioned for review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, concluding that the plain language of 441a(d)(3) precludes agency agreements between state committees and the NRSC.",Law and Crime
