"Plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of campaign financing and political advertising restrictions imposed under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 81. A three-judge court held some portions of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others. The parties appealed. Plaintiffs claimed that various amendments made by BCRA to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 2 U.S.C.S. _ 431 et seq., and the Communications Act of 1934 violated, inter alia, their rights to freedom of speech and association under the First Amendment and were facially unconstitutional. The Court found, inter alia, that (1) ""soft"" money prohibitions under 2 U.S.C.S. _ 441i(a) were justified by Congress's desire to prevent the actual and apparent corruption of federal candidates and officeholders; (2) restrictions under _ 441i(b) on state and local party committees' use of soft money were necessary to prevent those committees' use as a conduit for soft money; (3) _ 441i(d)'s limits on contributions to tax-exempt organizations applied only to funds not raised in compliance with FECA; (4) restrictions under 2 U.S.C.S. _ 434 did not have to be limited to ""express advocacy"" and could encompass issue advertising; (5) limits on independent expenditures under 2 U.S.C.S. _ 441a(d)(4) were invalid; and (6) recordkeeping requirements under 47 U.S.C.S. _ 315(e) were virtually identical to existing regulations and were valid.",Civil Rights
"The plaintiff company entered into a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers for the construction of a flood-control dam. Under the ""changed conditions"" clause the contractor claimed extra compensation, but this claim was denied by the contracting officer. Pursuant to the ""disputes"" clause of the contract, under which all disputes concerning questions of fact arising under the contract were to be decided by the contracting officer, subject to appeal by the contractor to the head of the department concerned, a timely appeal was taken to the Board of Claims and Appeals of the Corps of Engineers. After an adversary hearing, at which a record was made and each side offered its evidence, with opportunity for cross-examination, the Board decided against the contractor. Almost 6 years later the contractor brought the present action for breach of contract in the Court of Claims, alleging that the administrative decisions were ""capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or were not supported by substantial evidence."" The quoted language describes exceptions recognized in the Wunderlich Act (41 USC 321) to the general rule stated therein that any decision by the head of a federal agency under customary disputes clauses in government contracts is ""final and conclusive."" Over the government's objection, evidence was received de novo, including evidence which had not been before the Board. (157 Ct Cl ____.) Judgment was rendered for the contractor.",Government Operations

"An accused who, when 19 years old, had allegedly killed a convenience store clerk while robbing the store, was convicted in a Texas trial court on a charge of capital murder. At the punishment phase of the trial, the defense offered testimony by the accused's father attributing the accused's actions to factors including the accused's youth and immaturity, and defense counsel's closing argument stressed the capacity of the young to change for the better. The trial court instructed the jury (1) to answer two special issues prescribed by the state's capital sentencing statute, namely whether (a) the conduct causing the death was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result, and (b) there was a probability that the accused would commit violent criminal acts constituting a continuing threat to society; and (2) to take into consideration, in answering the special issues, all aggravating or mitigating evidence submitted in either phase of the trial. The jury unanimously answered both special issues in the affirmative, and the accused was accordingly sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, affirming the accused's conviction and sentence, rejected various challenges, none of which related to the penalty phase instructions (773 SW2d 322). Subsequently--after the United States Supreme Court held in a 1989 decision that Texas' special issues had not allowed a capital sentencing jury to give proper mitigating effect to evidence of a defendant's mental retardation and abused childhood as required under the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment--the accused in the case at hand filed a motion for rehearing in the Court of Criminal Appeals, which motion argued that the special issues did not allow for adequate consideration of the accused's youth. However, the Court of Criminal Appeals, rejecting the accused's argument, found that the second special issue allowed the jury to express a reasoned moral response to mitigating evidence of the accused's youth.",Law and Crime
"Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a unified ""removal proceeding"" for exclusions and deportations alike. But the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substantive grounds for the two actions. One list specifies what crimes render an alien excludable, see 8 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1182(a), while anothersometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent-list specifies what crimes render an alien deportable, see ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1227(a). Until repealed in 1996, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds. By its terms, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well. Although Congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) in 1996, see ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1229b, ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c)'s broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c)'s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 326. In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the basis for exclusion. Unless that ground is one of the two falling outside ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c)'s scope, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The BIA then determines whether to grant relief based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense. This case concerns the BIA's method for applying ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) in the deportation context. The BIA's approach, known as the ""comparablegrounds"" rule, evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has a close analogue in the statute's list of exclusion grounds. If the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes ""substantially equivalent"" to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) relief. But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief, even if the alien's particular offense falls within an exclusion ground. Petitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1988. After he pleaded guilty to another crime in 2005, DHS commenced a deportation action, charging him with having committed an ""aggravated felony"" involving ""a crime of violence"" based on his manslaughter conviction. The Immigration Judge ordered Judulang's deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding Judulang ineligible for ¬¨¬®‚àö√º212(c) relief because the ""crime of violence"" deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground. The Ninth Circuit, having previously upheld the BIA's comparablegrounds rule, denied Judulang's petition for review.",Immigration
"A California electric power company, licensed to produce hydroelectric power under Part I of the Federal Power Act, sought to apply an increase in rates granted by the state Public Utilities Commission, to contracts with the Navy Department (which used the power in Nevada) and with a Nevada county. Both of these purchasers purchased the power in California and transmitted it across the state boundaries on their own lines. All of the power purchased by the county was resold in Nevada, while only a small part of the power purchased by the Navy was so resold. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the rates of electric power so sold were subject to exclusive regulation by the Federal Power Commission under the provision of Part II of the Federal Power Act granting the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over electric power transmitted for sale at wholesale in interstate commerce. The California Public Utilities Commission's determination of state authority over the rates had been denied review by the highest state court; the Federal Power Commission's determination of its exclusive authority over the rates had been approved by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California Power Co. v.

"Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the North Carolina Department of Correction, certain prison officials prohibited inmates from soliciting other inmates to join a prisoners' union, barred all meetings of such union, and refused to deliver packets of union publications that had been mailed in bulk to several inmates for redistribution among other prisoners. The union brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, challenging these policies and alleging that the restrictions placed on the union violated the First Amendment rights of it and its members and that the refusal to grant the union those privileges accorded to other organizations operating within the prison system deprived the union of equal protection of the laws. A three-judge District Court was convened, and the court, finding merit in the union's arguments, granted injunctive relief in favor of the union (409 F Supp 937).",Civil Rights
"During collective-bargaining negotiations between a union representing teachers at a Pennsylvania high school and the local school board, a cellular phone conversation took place between the union's chief negotiator and a teacher who was president of the local union. In the course of the conversation, the teacher remarked that because of the board's intransigence, ""we're gonna have to go to their, their homes . . . [t]o blow off their front porches . . ."" An unknown person intercepted and recorded the conversation and left the tape in the mailbox of the president of a local citizens' organization that opposed the union's proposals. The organization president, in turn, gave a copy of the tape to a local radio station's commentator, who played the tape on his public affairs talk show. Another radio station also broadcast the tape, and some local newspapers published the tape's contents. The union negotiator and the teacher brought a damages suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against the radio commentator, the radio stations, and the organization president, under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (18 USCS 2510 et seq.) and a Pennsylvania wiretapping statute. Among the allegations in the suit were that (1) the interception violated 18 USCS 2511(1)(a), which generally made it illegal intentionally to intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication; and (2) the publication violated 18 USCS 2511(1)(c), which made it illegal for a person intentionally to disclose the contents of any such communication, where the person knew or had reason to know that the disclosed information was obtained through the illegal interception of the communication. The District Court, in denying the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, concluded that (1) an individual who disclosed an illegally intercepted electronic communication could be in violation of 2511(1)(c) even if the individual was not involved in the interception; and (2) imposing liability on the defendants would not violate the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit--in reversing the District Court's order that denied summary judgment to the defendants and in ordering a remand with directions to grant such judgment--reasoned that 2511(1)(c) and the Pennsylvania statute were invalid under the First Amendment as deterring significantly more speech than necessary to protect the privacy interests at stake (200 F3d 109).",Law and Crime
"Nonimmigrant alien students at the University of Maryland, each of whom was dependent on a parent who resided in Maryland and who held a nonimmigrant visa as a nonimmigrant alien under 101(a)(15)(G)(iv) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 USCS 1101(a)(15)(G)(iv))--which defines the officers or employees of international treaty organizations and the members of their immediate families as nonimmigrant aliens--were denied ""in-state"" status and consequent tuition reductions on the ground that they could not qualify under the University's policy of granting such status only to students who were ""domiciliaries"" of Maryland or who were financially dependent upon parents who were ""domiciliaries"" of Maryland. After unsuccessfully seeking to obtain ""in-state"" status by pursuing their remedies through the administrative process established by the University, the students brought a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the University and its president, alleging that the failure to grant ""in-state"" status violated various federal laws and the Constitution, including the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause was violated (420 F Supp 541), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed (556 F2d 573).",Civil Rights
"After the directors of a corporation had authorized the use of corporate funds to finance the cost of advertisements made in connection with the 1972 presidential election, one of the stockholders brought a two-count action against the directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to obtain injunctive relief against further corporate expenditures in connection with the 1972 election or any future campaign, and to obtain compensatory and punitive damages in favor of the corporation. One of the counts alleged federal jurisdiction in the District Court and asserted a private claim for relief under 18 USCS 610--a criminal statute prohibiting corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections. Following the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction and an affirmance of the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, there were subsequent proceedings in the District Court at which the stockholder filed an amended complaint. Summary judgment for the defendant directors was granted, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that since the amended complaint sought damages on behalf of the corporation for violation of 610, the controversy was not moot, although the election which occasioned it was over, and that a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief, was proper to remedy the violation of 610 (496 F2d 416).",Law and Crime

"An Indian tribe owned and operated a motor inn in Oklahoma at which it conducted bingo games and sold cigarettes. The state of Oklahoma filed a complaint in the District Court in Murray County, Oklahoma, against the tribe and the manager of the inn, which complaint sought to collect unpaid taxes on the cigarette sales and bingo receipts. The tribe, asserting federal question jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1331, removed the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District. The state moved to remand the case on the ground that the complaint alleged on its face only state statutory violations and state tax liabilities; but the District Court, holding that the complaint implicated the federal question of tribal immunity by seeking to apply state law to an Indian tribe, denied the motion, and subsequently dismissed the action on the ground that it was barred by tribal immunity. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the state's complaint implicitly contained the federal question of tribal immunity (822 F2d 951). The United States Supreme Court (484 US 973, 98 L Ed 2d 480, 108 S Ct 481) vacated the Court of Appeals' decision and remanded for reconsideration in the light of a decision in which the Supreme Court had held that federal question jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of a well-pleaded complaint. On remand, the Court of Appeals, again affirming the judgment of the District Court, held that the immunity issue was inherent in the complaint because of the parties involved and that, because of the state's failure to allege the tribe's consent to suit or waiver of immunity, the complaint was not ""well-pleaded"" (846 F2d 1258).",Law and Crime

"These two, consolidated cases presented the question of what statute of limitations should apply to a suit by an employee or employees against an employer and the union, alleging that the employer had breached a provision of a collective bargaining agreement, and the union had breached its duty of fair representation by mishandling the ensuing grievance-and-arbitration proceedings. In the first case (No. 81-2386), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted summary judgment for the employer and the union, holding that the state 30-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards applied both to the claim against the employer and the claim against the union (524 F Supp 721). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed on the basis of the District Court's order (679 F2d 879). In the second case (No. 81-2408), the United States District Court for the Western District of New York dismissed the complaint against both defendants, holding that the entire suit was governed by New York's 90-day statute of limitation for actions to vacate arbitration awards.

"Based on a study of mortality tables and its own experience, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power determined that its female employees would, as a class, outlive its male employees. Accordingly, the Department required its female employees to make significantly larger pension fund contributions then the males, with the result that each female employee took home less pay than a male earning the same salary. A class action suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all women employed or formerly employed by the Department, seeking an injunction and restitution of excess contributions to the plan. While the action was pending, California enacted a law prohibiting municipal agencies from requiring higher pension fund contributions from female employees, and the Department amended its plan to draw no distinction in contributions or benefits on the basis of sex. The District Court held that the prior contribution differential violated 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-2(a)(1)), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against ""any individual"" on the basis of sex with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.

The defendant contended that the earlier conviction could not properly provide the basis for his being sentenced as a recidivist because that conviction had been expunged under the Youth Corrections Act following his successful completion of the 2-year probationary term.

"The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 USCS 1961 et seq.)

"In consolidated actions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the major creditors and sole stockholder of a railroad in reorganization challenged the constitutionality of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 USCS 701 et seq.), which, in an effort to solve a rail transportation crisis precipitated when eight major railroads in the northeast and midwest regions of the country entered reorganization proceedings under 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCS 205), was enacted to supplement 77. The Regional Rail Reorganization Act provides generally for (1) reorganization of the regions' railroads pursuant to a final system plan to be established by a government corporation, whereby rail properties are to be transferred to a private state-incorporated corporation (Conrail) in return for securities of Conrail, plus a limited amount of federally guaranteed obligations of the government corporation and other benefits accruing to the railroads under the transfer (45 USCS 716(d)); (2) the submission of the final plan to Congress, with the plan to become effective unless disapproved by either House (45 USCS 718); (3) a Special Court which has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings regarding the final plan, and which after directing the conveyance of rail properties to Conrail, shall determine whether such conveyances are fair and equitable, directing any necessary reallocation or issuance of Conrail or government securities to assure the fairness of the consideration exchanged for the rail properties (45 USCS 743); and (4) continuation of rail service until the final system plan becomes effective, unless discontinuance is authorized by the government corporation and not reasonably opposed by any state or local transportation authority (45 USCS 744(f)). The plaintiffs' primary contention was that the Act's provisions as to conveyance of the railroad properties to Conrail and the mandatory continuation of rail service pending implementation of the final reorganization plan effected a taking of rail properties without payment of just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs also asserted that the Act violated the uniformity requirement of the bankruptcy clause (Article I, 8, cl 4), which authorizes Congress to establish ""uniform laws"" on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States. The three-judge District Court found for the plaintiffs, holding, inter alia, that (1) the Act's provisions as to continuation of rail services violated the Fifth Amendment, since the Act precluded an action against the government under the provisions of the Tucker Act (28 USCS 1491) conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Claims of any claim against the United States founded upon the Constitution, and (2) certain provisions of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act violated the uniformity requirement of the bankruptcy clause (383 F Supp 510).",Transportation

"28 USCS 455 defines the circumstances that mandate the disqualification of federal judges, and, in particular, 28 USCS 455(a) disqualifies a federal judge from acting in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality ""might reasonably be questioned."" A pharmacist who was also a promoter became interested in constructing a Louisiana hospital whose successful operation would be dependent on the acquisition from the state of a ""certificate of need."" The pharmacist, after forming a hospital corporation which was to obtain the certificate, reached an agreement with a national health management company--an agreement which the company understood to transfer ownership of the hospital corporation. The company obtained a certificate of need in the name of the hospital corporation, but a dispute arose with the pharmacist as to whether (1) ownership had been transferred, or (2) the transfer was conditioned upon fulfillment of an alleged additional understanding. The corporate successor of the health management company accordingly sought a declaratory judgment against the pharmacist in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, as to the ownership of the hospital corporation, and the case was assigned to a judge who happened to be a trustee of a university, but who, at the time the case was tried, was not conscious of the fact that (1) the university, which owned the desired tract of land for the hospital project, as well as adjacent land which would benefit from the project, was engaged in continuing negotiations with the pharmacist, and (2) the success of the negotiations depended upon a conclusion by the trustee judge that the pharmacist controlled the hospital corporation and the corporation's certificate. On March 16, 1982, the trustee judge entered judgment in favor of the pharmacist, and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Approximately 10 months later, the successor company learned of the judge's trusteeship and the university-pharmacist negotiations, and moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which allows relief from judgment for ""any other reason justifying relief""--on the ground that the trustee judge had been disqualified under 455(a) at the time the judge heard the action and entered judgment in favor of the pharmacist. The trustee judge denied the motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to a second District Court judge for a factual hearing, after which the second judge found that (1) the trustee judge had previously had actual knowledge of the university's interest in 1981; (2) but, at the time the action came to trial, the trustee judge, due to a temporary lapse of memory, had forgotten about this interest until March 24, 1982--after judgment was entered but within the 10-day period allowed for filing a motion for new trial--when the trustee judge had examined several university letters to him, including one dated March 12. The second judge, understanding 455(a) to be limited to a situation in which there was actual knowledge of the disqualifying circumstances, (1) held that the trustee judge had not been required to recuse himself under 455(a), and (2) therefore denied the Rule 60(b)(6) motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, expressing the view that (1) regardless of the trustee judge's actual knowledge, the judge was disqualified under 455(a), because the judge had constructive knowledge of the disqualifying circumstances--that is, a reasonable observer would have expected the judge to know them; and (2) under Rule 60(b)(6), the appropriate remedy was to vacate the judgment in favor of the pharmacist (796 F2d 796).

The accused was convicted on all counts, and was sentenced pursuant to 18 USCS 924(c)(1), which provides that whoever, during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime, uses a firearm that is a machinegun or is equipped with a silencer shall be sentenced to imprisonment for 30 years. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in affirming on appeal, (1) rejected the argument that 924(c)(1) covered only situations in which the firearm is used as a weapon, and that the provision did not extend to persons who use a firearm solely as a medium of exchange or for barter; and (2) expressed the view that for purposes of 924(c)(1), any use of a firearm to facilitate in any manner the commission of the offense sufficed (957 F2d 835).",Law and Crime
"Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agents conducted factory surveys pursuant to warrant by which they entered employers' worksites to determine whether any illegal aliens were present as employees. Four employees and their union representative brought actions challenging the constitutionality of INS factory surveys and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The United States District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment in favor of the INS. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the factory surveys amounted to a seizure of the entire work forces and that the INS could not question individual employees during these surveys unless INS agents had a reasonable suspicion that the employee to be questioned was an illegal alien (681 F2d 624).",Immigration
"One convicted in the United States District Court for the Territory of Hawaii on a charge of murder in the first degree questioned the propriety and sufficiency of instructions and the power of the court to sentence him to death by hanging, and particularly the adequacy of the instructions as to the jury's statutory power to determine whether the penalty should be death or life imprisonment.",Law and Crime
"The Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS 101 et seq.) includes a provision that a debt shall not be dischargeable in bankruptcy ""to the extent"" that the debt is ""for money . . . obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud"" (11 USCS 523(a)(2)(A)). In Brown v Felsen (1979) 442 US 127, 60 L Ed 2d 767, 99 S Ct 2205, the Supreme Court held that under a predecessor of 523(a)(2)(A), the doctrine of claim preclusion did not prevent a Bankruptcy Court from looking beyond the record of a state-court proceeding and the documents which had terminated that proceeding (a stipulation and consent judgment) in order to decide whether the debt then at issue (a debt embodied in the stipulation and consent judgment) was a debt for money obtained by fraud. In the case at hand, two purchasers of a company sued the company's two sellers, who were husband and wife, in a North Carolina state court for, among other matters, alleged fraud in connection with the sale. In 1995, the parties settled the lawsuit. The settlement agreement and related documents (1) included recitations that the parties did not admit to any liability or wrongdoing; (2) released all related claims; and (3) provided for some payments to the buyers, including payments on a $ 100,000 promissory note. The buyers then voluntarily dismissed the state-court lawsuit with prejudice. Subsequently, the sellers failed to make the first payment on the promissory note and filed for bankruptcy. A Bankruptcy Court ordered liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS 701 et seq.). The buyers asserted a claim for the $ 100,000 promissory-note debt and asked the Bankruptcy Court to find the debt nondischargeable under 523(a)(2)(A). While the seller-husband agreed to a consent order holding the debt nondischargeable, the seller-wife contested nondischargeability. The Bankruptcy Court, finding the promissory-note debt dischargeable, denied the buyers' claim. A Federal District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court.",Law and Crime
"Petitioner associations sued respondents, California's South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) and its officials, claiming that _ 209 (42 U.S.C.S. _ 7543) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.S. _ 7401 et seq., preempted six local Fleet Rules. The district court granted summary judgment to respondents, upholding the Rules in their entirety. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Certiorari was granted. The District enacted South Coast, Cal., Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. Fleet R. 1186.1, 1191, 1192, 1193, 1194, and 1196, which prohibited the purchase or lease by various public and private fleet operators of vehicles that did not comply with stringent emission requirements. The district court determined that _ 209(a) of the CAA did not preempt these Fleet Rules, because they addressed the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale. However, the Court determined that at least certain aspects of the Fleet Rules were preempted. The text of CAA _ 209(a) and the CAA's structure did not support the district court's manufacturer-specific interpretation of ""standard"" or the resulting distinction between purchase and sale restrictions. The Court found that the command, accompanied by sanctions, that certain purchasers could buy only vehicles with particular emission characteristics was as much an ""attempt to enforce"" a ""standard"" as a command, accompanied by sanctions, that a certain percentage of a manufacturer's sales volume had to consist of such vehicles.",Environment
"draft registrant, after his claim of draft exemption as a conscientious objector had been denied by selective service authorities refused to submit to induction and was convicted of violating the Universal Military Training and Service Act. It was undisputed that the defendant was a sincere Jehovah's Witness and conscientious objector to participation in war, but the Department of Justice, in making recommendations to the Appeal Board that defendant's claim be denied, expressed the view that he had failed to establish that he was opposed to ""war in any form,"" because the defendant had stated, in answering a form submitted to the selective service authorities, that he believed in the use of force in defending ""his ministry, Kingdom interests and . . . his fellow brethren.""",Law and Crime
