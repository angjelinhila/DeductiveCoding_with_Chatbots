"Under Article 17 of the 1929 treaty on international air transportation known as the Warsaw Convention, a carrier is liable for damages sustained through the accident of the carrier in the event of a passenger's death, wounding, or other ""bodily injury"" (which term is a translation of the term ""l sion corporelle"" in the authentic French text). Both the United States and the Bahamas adhere to the Warsaw Convention. In 1983, shortly after a passenger airplane's takeoff from Miami on a flight bound for the Bahamas, all three engines lost oil pressure. As the airplane began losing altitude rapidly, the passengers were informed that the airplane would be ditched in the Atlantic Ocean. One engine was eventually restarted, and the airplane landed safely in Miami. A group of passengers on the flight, each of whom claimed damages solely for mental distress, brought separate actions against the carrier. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in a consolidated proceeding, dismissed all claims, including a claim for recovery under the Warsaw Convention. With respect to such claim, the District Court ruled that the carrier was not liable because mental anguish alone was not compensable under Article 17 (629 F Supp 307). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, reversing, held that the Warsaw Convention provided recovery for a passenger's purely emotional injuries unaccompanied by physical injury because the term ""l sion corporelle,"" as used in Article 17, encompassed purely emotional distress (872 F2d 1462).",Law and Crime

"Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, on a charge of unlawful possession and sale of marijuana. Trying the case without a jury, the court admitted an oral confession made by defendant only after the police had told her that state financial aid of her infant children would be cut off, and her children taken from her, if she did not ""cooperate."" It also appeared that these threats were made while she was encircled in her apartment by three police officers and a twice convicted felon who had purportedly ""set her up""; and that there was no friend or adviser to whom she might turn, and she had no previous experience with the criminal law, and no reason not to believe that the police had ample power to carry out their threats. The judgment of conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Illinois (21 Ill 2d 63, 171 NE2d 17), this court subsequently issuing a certificate that decision of defendant's federal claim of violation of due process was necessary to its judgment.",Law and Crime

"While petitioner Kingsley was awaiting trial in county jail, officers forcibly removed him from his cell when he refused to comply with their instructions. Kingsley filed a complaint in Federal District Court claiming, as relevant here, that two of the officers used excessive force against him in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. At the trial's conclusion, the District Court instructed the jury that Kingsley was required to prove, inter alia, that the officers ""recklessly disregarded [Kingsley's] safety"" and ""acted with reckless disregard of [his] rights."" The jury found in the officers' favor. On appeal, Kingsley argued that the jury instruction did not adhere to the proper standard for judging a pretrial detainee's excessive force claim, namely, objective unreasonableness. The Seventh Circuit disagreed, holding that the law required a subjective inquiry into the officers' state of mind, i.e., whether the officers actually intended to violate, or recklessly disregarded, Kingsley's rights.",Law and Crime
"The bareboat charterer of an oil tanker which was involved in a collision with a barge being towed by a tugboat, instituted an admiralty action in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against the owners of the barge and tug to recover for damages to the tanker, and a cross-libel was filed for damages to the barge. The evidence showed that the vessels were proceeding in opposite directions, on opposite sides of a 500-foot wide river channel; the tanker, traveling at about 7 knots, had clear visibility ahead for almost 2 miles, and sighted the tug a mile ahead, losing sight of it when the tug entered a heavy fog bank which was localized on the tug's side of the channel only; while in the fog, the tug captain, mistakenly fearing an imminent collision, executed a U-turn into the channel in front of the tanker; the tanker sighted the tug emerging from the fog at a right angle to the tanker, approximately 900 feet ahead, and immediately ordered full astern; and the tug executed its U-turn safely, but before the tanker could stop, the barge in tow crashed into the tanker. The District Court found that the collision resulted solely from the tug's negligence, and dismissed the cross-libel (304 F Supp 519). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the finding that the tug had been negligent, but determined that the tanker was also negligent in violating the ""half-distance rule""--which, as interpretative of the mandate of Rule 16 of the Inland Rules of Navigation that vessels shall proceed at ""a moderate speed"" in fog, requires that a vessel proceed at such rate of speed as will enable her to come to a standstill, by reversing her engines at full speed, before she collides with a vessel which she should see through the fog (451 F2d 1369). The Court of Appeals therefore reversed with directions that the District Court should determine the amount of damages and assess them under the divided damages rule.",Law and Crime
"The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) generally obligates private employers offering pension plans to adhere to an array of rules designed to ensure plan solvency and protect plan participants. ""[C]hurch plan[s],"" however, are exempt from those regulations. 29 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1003(b)(2). From the beginning, ERISA has defined a ""church plan"" as ""a plan established and maintained ... for its employees ... by a church."" ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1002(33)(A). Congress then amended the statute to expand that definition, adding the provision whose effect is at issue here: ""A plan established and maintained for its employees ... by a church ... includes a plan maintained by an organization . . . the principal purpose . .. of which is the administration or funding of [such] plan ... for the employees of a church ... ,if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church."" ¬¨¬®‚àö√º 1002(33)(C)(i). (This opinion refers to the organizations described in that provision as ""principal-purpose organizations."") Petitioners, who identify themselves as three church-affiliated nonprofits that run hospitals and other healthcare facilities (collectively, hospitals), offer their employees defined-benefit pension plans. Those plans were established by the hospitals themselves, and are managed by internal employee-benefits committees. Respondents, current and former hospital employees, filed class actions alleging that the hospitals' pension plans do not fall within ERISA's churchplan exemption because they were not established by a church. The District Courts, agreeing with the employees, held that a plan must be established by a church to qualify as a church plan. The Courts of Appeals affirmed.",Law and Crime
"The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA) requires that an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan pay a fixed and certain debt to the plan, representing the employer's proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. Under collective bargaining agreements entered into by several thousand employers in the construction industry in southern California and southern Nevada, the employers agreed to pay certain amounts to a pension trust, an employer's obligation for pension benefits to employees ending when the employer pays the appropriate contribution to the trust. The trustees administering the pension filed suit against the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the wholly owned government corporation administering the insurance program for participants in both single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, claiming that the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requiring premium payments from, and imposing contingent termination liability on, employers with respect to pension plans for their employees were unconstitutional as depriving the trustees, the employers, and the plan participants of property without due process and without proper compensation, and further claiming that the withdrawal liability provisions of the MPPAA violated the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The United States District Court for the Central District of California ultimately granted summary judgment for the PBGC, holding that the withdrawal liability provisions of the MPPAA did not violate the Taking Clause.",Labor

"The state of West Virginia entered into a compact with other states in the Ohio River basin to control pollution of the river. Congress consented to the compact. To carry out its purposes, the compact created an administrative commission composed of representatives from each state and from the United States. The states agreed to contribute to the expenses of the commission, although no obligations could be incurred without prior appropriations or consent of the state legislatures. Mandamus was brought against the state auditor of West Virginia to compel him to pay out moneys appropriated for the commission. In denying this relief, the West Virginia court held invalid the statute approving the compact, on the grounds that (1) the compact was an unconstitutional delegation of power to an agency outside the state, and (2) it was a violation of the debt limitation provision of the state constitution, in attempting to bind future legislatures to make appropriations for the commission.",Environment
"Under 28 USCS 1441(b), any suit filed in a state court is removable to a Federal District Court, without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties, if the District Court would have had original jurisdiction over the suit as a civil action founded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Two families residing in Canada and Scotland, respectively, filed suits in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, against the corporation which manufactured and distributed a drug. Each complaint alleged that a child was born with multiple deformities as a result of the mother's ingestion of the drug during pregnancy. In each complaint, five of the six counts asserted various state common-law theories, while the sixth count claimed that (1) the drug was misbranded in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) (21 USCS 301 et seq.) because the drug's label did not provide adequate warning of dangerousness, and (2) this violation in the promotion of the drug constituted negligence which proximately caused the injuries suffered. Under 1441(b), the corporation filed a timely petition for removal to a District Court. The two cases were consolidated, and the District Court (1) held that the drug-misbranding count of each complaint alleged a cause of action under federal law; (2) denied a motion to remand the litigation to the Ohio court; and (3) granted the corporation's motion to dismiss the litigation on forum non conveniens grounds. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, expressing the view that (1) the parties agreed that the FDCA did not create or imply a federal private right of action for individuals injured as a result of a violation of the FDCA; (2) the plaintiffs' causes of action therefore did not necessarily depend on a question of federal law; (3) the causes of action consequently did not arise under federal law; and (4) the causes of action were therefore improperly removed to federal court and ought to be remanded to the Court of Common Pleas (766 F2d 1005).",Law and Crime
"A State may take custody of abandoned property located within its borders; this process is commonly known as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´escheatment.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ When abandoned property is intangible, however, the lack of a physical location means that multiple States may have arguable claims. In these cases, the question is which States have the right to escheat two financial products sold by banks on behalf of MoneyGram: Agent Checks and Teller‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s Checks (collectively, Disputed Instruments). Operating much like money orders, both products are prepaid financial instruments used to transfer funds to a named payee. When these prepaid instruments are not presented for payment within a certain period of time, they are deemed abandoned, and, currently, MoneyGram applies the common-law escheatment practices outlined in Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U. S. 674. There the Court established the rule that the proceeds of abandoned financial products should escheat to the State of the creditor‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s last known address, id., at 680‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®681, or where such records are not kept, to the State in which the company holding the funds is incorporated, id., at 682. Because MoneyGram does not, as a matter of regular business practice, keep records of creditor addresses for the two products at issue in this case, it applies the secondary common-law rule and transmits the abandoned proceeds to its State of incorporation, i.e., Delaware. Multiple States invoked this Court‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s original jurisdiction to determine whether the abandoned proceeds of the Disputed Instruments are governed by the Disposition of Abandoned Money Orders and Traveler‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s Checks Act (Federal Disposition Act or FDA) rather than the common law. The FDA provides that ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´a money order . . . or other similar written instrument (other than a third party bank check)‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ should generally escheat to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´the State in which such . . . instrument was purchased.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ 12 U.

"Under the National Labor Relations Act, as originally enacted, which made no provision for enjoining union activities as constituting unfair labor practices, the Supreme Court, in Allen-Bradley Local, U.E.R.M.W. v Wisconsin Employment Relations Board (1942) 315 US 740, 86 L ed 1154, 62 S Ct 820, ruled that the act did not deprive a state of power to enjoin mass picketing, threats to employees desiring to work, physical injury or property damage, obstruction of the entrance to and egress from the place of work, obstructing streets and public roads surrounding such place, and picketing the homes of employees. The issue in the present case was whether state power to enjoin such violent union conduct was eliminated with the passage of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which empowered the National Labor Relations Board to enjoin, among other unfair union labor practices, coercion of employees who wished to refrain from striking.",Labor
"In the Circuit Court of Christian County, Kentucky, a defendant was indicted for committing first-degree sodomy with three children. After a jury was sworn and the charge involving one of the children was dismissed, but before the presentation of evidence, the trial court conducted an in-chambers hearing to determine if the two remaining children were competent to testify. Over the defendant's objection, the defendant, though not his counsel, was excluded from the hearing. After the trial court asked questions of the children about such matters as their ages and ability to tell the truth, (1) the trial court determined that both children were competent to testify; (2) the two children testified at trial; (3) both children were cross-examined at trial by the defendant's counsel; and (4) the defendant was eventually convicted of sodomy. On appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court, the defendant argued that his exclusion from the hearing had (1) denied him due process, and (2) violated his right, under the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment, to confront the witnesses against him. The Kentucky Supreme Court then reversed the defendant's conviction, expressing the view that the defendant's confrontation rights had been violated, because the defendant had an absolute right to be present at the competency hearing, which was a crucial stage of the trial: the defendant's trial might not have taken place had the trial court determined that the children were not competent to testify (712 SW2d 939).",Law and Crime
"The Supreme Court of Washington concluded that Wash. Rev.

Those cases were not balancing constitutional rights in the manner the union suggested, for the simple reason that unions had no constitutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees. The Court held that the campaign-finance cases that the union invoked were not on point because as applied to public-sector unions, _ 42.17.760 was not fairly described as a restriction on how the union could spend ""its"" money; it was a condition placed upon the union's extraordinary state entitlement to acquire and spend other people's money.

According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State.

"In testimony given before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York under a grant of immunity, two owners of a concrete construction company stated that neither they nor their company had participated in a so-called ""Club"" of six concrete companies to whom large construction contracts in Manhattan purportedly had been allocated during the 1980's by a criminal organization, in exchange for a share of the proceeds. The grand jury subsequently indicted several defendants on numerous counts of racketeering and fraud, based on the criminal organization's alleged activities in rigging bids on construction projects by use of the organization's influence over labor unions and its control over concrete supply. At a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the government attempted to show that the construction company owned by the grand jury witnesses belonged to the ""Club."" The two owners were subpoenaed by the defense to testify at trial, but both invoked their privilege against self-incrimination under the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. The defense moved that the grand jury testimony of the two owners be admitted into evidence under Rule 804(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that the hearsay rule does not exclude former testimony by an unavailable declarant if the party against whom such testimony is offered had an opportunity and ""similar motive"" to develop such testimony. The District Court, ruling that the government had not had a similar motive, denied the defense's motion, and the jury subsequently convicted the defendants. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing, held that the District Court had erred in excluding the two owners' grand jury testimony, because the ""similar motive"" element of Rule 804(b)(1) evaporated when the Government obtained immunized testimony in a grand jury proceeding from a witness who refused to testify at trial (937 F2d 797, amended on other grounds 952 F2d 623).",Law and Crime

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that convictions that were not formally consolidated for sentencing may be considered functionally consolidated, for purposes of the Guidelines, if the convictions were factually or logically related and sentencing was joint. In the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, a defendant--who had four prior felony convictions in state court for gas-station robberies and one for a drug offense--pleaded guilty to federal charges of armed bank robbery. At sentencing, the defendant contended that her drug conviction had been consolidated for sentencing with the robbery convictions--which the prosecution conceded were ""related"" to each other--as the defendant argued that (1) the robberies allegedly had been motivated by her drug habit; (2) the drugs had been found in her home by police searching for evidence of the robberies; and (3) the same state-court judge had (a) heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases in a single proceeding, (b) issued sentences in all five cases at the same time, and (c) ordered that the drug sentence run concurrently with the sentences for robbery. The District Court, however, ruled that the robbery and drug cases had not been consolidated, either formally or functionally, as the District Court placed greater weight on the circumstances that (1) the robbery and drug offenses had been charged in separate indictments and handled by different prosecutors, both at trial and before the sentencing court; (2) the defendant's guilty plea on the drug charge had been heard in a separate proceeding; and (3) the robbery and drug sentences had been issued in separate judgments.

In an action brought in Texas for the loss by the original owners and a corporation wholly owned by them, to which the boat's legal title had been transferred, the insurer denied liability because of breaches of policy warranties providing that, without the insurer's consent, the boat could not be transferred and that it must be used solely for private pleasure purposes.

"The Private Express Statutes (PES) (18 USCS 1693-1699, 39 USCS 601-606) codify the United States Postal Service's monopoly over the carriage of letters in and from the United States. Pursuant to a provision of the PES (39 USCS 601(b)), which provision allows the Postal Service to suspend the PES restrictions on any mail route where the public interest so requires, the Postal Service issued a regulation authorizing ""international remailing,"" a practice by which private couriers deposit with foreign postal services letters destined for foreign addresses. A postal workers' union and a letter carriers' union, challenging the regulation, sued the Postal Service in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 USCS 702). The unions alleged that (1) the decision to permit international remailing, with its attendant loss of revenue to the Postal Service, would inflict harm on union members through the loss of employment opportunities, and (2) the rule-making record was inadequate to support a finding that such a suspension of the PES was in the public interest. The District Court, granting summary judgment in favor of the Postal Service, said that (1) although the unions had shown threatened injury, they lacked standing to challenge the regulation, because the unions' asserted interest in retention of employment opportunities did not fall within the ""zone of interests"" protected by the PES; and (2) the Postal Service's decision was not in excess of statutory authority and was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion (701 F Supp 880). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--remanding the case to the District Court to vacate the grant of summary judgment--held that (1) the unions were within the zone of interests of the PES, because the PES were an integral part of a comprehensive statutory scheme that addressed the welfare and employment of postal employees, and thus the unions had standing, and (2) the Postal Service's regulation was arbitrary and capricious agency action (282 App DC 5, 891 F2d 304).",Labor

ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum penalty for ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g) offenders with at least three prior convictions for specified felonies ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´committed on occasions different from one another.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º924(e)(1). Wooden‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s relevant criminal record included ten burglary convictions arising out of a single criminal episode in 1997, during which Wooden had unlawfully entered a one-building storage facility and stolen items from ten different storage units. Prosecutors indicted Wooden on ten counts of burglary‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üone for each storage unit‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üand Wooden pleaded guilty to all counts. Years later, at Wooden‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s sentencing hearing on his ¬¨¬®‚àö√º922(g) conviction, the District Court applied ACCA‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s penalty enhancement in accordance with the Government‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s view that Wooden had commenced a new ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´occasion‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ of criminal activity each time he left one storage unit and entered another. The resulting sentence was almost sixteen years, much higher than the statutory maximum for Wooden‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s crime absent such an enhancement. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that ACCA‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s occasions clause is satisfied whenever crimes take place at different moments in time‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üthat is, sequentially rather than simultaneously.",Law and Crime
"An Indiana limited partnership manufactured ethanol in Indiana for sale in Ohio and other states. Under an Ohio statute, a sales tax credit to fuel dealers for each gallon of ethanol sold as a motor vehicle fuel component (1) was made unavailable to ethanol coming from a state which did not grant tax advantages to Ohio-produced ethanol, and (2) was limited, for ethanol coming from a state which did allow credit for Ohio-produced ethanol, to an amount equivalent to that which such state allowed. After an Indiana tax exemption for ethanol was repealed, so as to make the limited partnership ineligible for the Ohio tax credit, the limited partnership, alleging that the Ohio statute violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Ohio Tax Commissioner in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. The Court of Common Pleas denied relief, and the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed, holding that the Ohio statute was neither protectionist nor unreasonably burdensome on interstate commerce (32 Ohio St 3d 206, 513 NE2d 258).",Law and Crime
