"After the expiration of collective bargaining agreements between an electrical workers' union and two electric companies, two union members who continued to work as supervisors for the respective companies were fined by the union for violating its constitution by working for employers that did not have a collective bargaining relationship with the union. The companies filed unfair labor practice charges against the union with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging that the union had restrained or coerced the companies in the selection of their representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, in violation of 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(b)(1)(B)). The administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed, finding that (1) the fined union members were supervisors within the meaning of 2(11) of the Act (29 USCS 152(11)), (2) as such, they were also employer-representatives within the meaning of 8(b)(1)(B), despite the fact that neither one performed collective bargaining or grievance adjustment duties, (3) the fact that the union did not have a collective bargaining relationship with the companies was irrelevant because the discipline could nonetheless have the effect of forcing the supervisors to quit, and (4) the union did in fact seek to represent the companies' employees at some future date (271 NLRB 995, 117 BNA LRRM 1056, 1984-85 CCH NLRB 16640). The NLRB adopted the ALJ's findings and conclusions, ordering the union to rescind the fines and expunge from the supervisors' records the disciplinary action taken against them. The NLRB sought enforcement of its order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Court of Appeals, reversing, (1) agreed that the supervisors were employer-representatives within the meaning of 8(b)(1)(B), (2) found that the union did not intend to represent the companies' employees, and (3) held that where a union does not represent or intend to represent a company's employees, there can be no 8(b)(1)(B) violation when a union disciplines members even if they are designated bargaining representatives (780 F2d 1489).",Labor

"Acting under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 USCS 1251 et seq.)--which authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set effluent limitations for existing ""point sources"" (pollution dischargers) under a plan whereby point sources are required, in 1977, to meet so-called BPT standards (standards based on application of the ""best practicable control-technology currently available"") (33 USCS 1311(b)(1)(A)), and, in 1987, to meet so-called BAT standards (standards based on application of the ""best available technology economically achievable"") (33 USCS 1311(b)(2)(A)), and which also provides, in 301(c) (33 USCS 1311(c)), for variances as to the 1987 BAT standards upon a showing that modified requirements, among other things, ""represent the maximum use of technology within the economic capability of the owner or operator"" of point sources--the EPA, in 1977, promulgated pollution discharge limitations in regulations for the coal mining industry and for that portion of the mineral mining and processing industry comprising the crushed stone, construction sand, and gravel categories, and included in its regulations variance provisions for such 1977 BPT standards, variances for the 1977 standards, unlike variances for the 1987 BAT standards, being neither expressly authorized nor required under the language of the Act, but having been indicated by the United States Supreme Court to be a necessary aspect of regulations setting BPT limitations. Thereafter, various plaintiffs connected with the coal mining and crushed stone industries brought actions in Federal Courts of Appeals challenging the 1977 regulations both in regard to the substantive standards and the variance provisions. Ultimately, upon transfer of the cases to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the Court of Appeals, in two decisions, (1) set aside the variance provisions as being ""unduly restrictive,"" because although they allowed for consideration of a variance applicant's greater than normal cost of implementation in ruling on a variance request, the provisions excluded from consideration the economic ability of an applicant to meet the cost of implementing the 1977 BPT standards, and (2) required the EPA to take into account, in granting variances relating to the 1977 BPT standards, the factors set out in 301(c) of the Act as considerations pertaining to variances for 1987 BAT standards (601 F2d 111 and 604 F2d 239).",Environment

"Respondent Hyatt sued petitioner Franchise Tax Board of California (Board) in Nevada state court for alleged torts committed during a tax audit. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected the Board's argument that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Nevada courts to apply California law and immunize the Board from liability. The court held instead that general principles of comity entitled the Board only to the same immunity that Nevada law afforded Nevada agencies. This Court affirmed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not prohibit Nevada from applying its own immunity law. On remand, the Nevada Supreme Court declined to apply a cap on tort liability applicable to Nevada state agencies. This Court reversed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Nevada courts to grant the Board the same immunity that Nevada agencies enjoy. The Court was equally divided, however, on whether to overrule Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 1182, 59 L.Ed.2d 416, which held that the Constitution does not bar suits brought by an individual against a State in the courts of another State.

"After being indicted for three counts of theft by a United States Postal Service employee and three counts of use of unauthorized credit cards, an accused agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas to one of the counts (""count four"")--in which the accused was charged with use of a particular unauthorized credit card issued by a certain bank--in exchange for the Federal Government's agreement (1) to dismiss the remaining counts, and (2) to forgo prosecution for any other offense arising in the federal district as part of the scheme alleged in the accused's indictment. During the plea proceeding, the government proffered evidence that the accused, in addition to having stolen the credit card identified in count four, also had stolen at least 15 other cards. The accused's counsel informed the court that the accused's guilty plea was confined to an admission of the facts pertaining to count four. The District Court accepted the accused's guilty plea. At a presentencing hearing, the government submitted that the accused should be ordered to pay restitution, pursuant to the restitution provisions of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), 18 USCS 3579 and 3580 (later recodified as 18 USCS 3663 and 3664), for the total of the bank's losses which related to the accused's alleged theft and use of 21 credit cards. In response, the accused offered to make restitution in an amount limited to the losses sustained by the bank as a result of the unauthorized uses of the credit card identified in count four. At sentencing, the District Court ordered the accused to make restitution to the bank in the amount requested by the government. The District Court denied the accused's motion to reduce and correct his sentence. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that the VWPA permitted a federal court to require restitution beyond that involved in the offense of conviction where there was a significant connection between the crime of conviction and similar actions which justified restitution (877 F2d 1256).",Law and Crime

"The first defendant had paid lottery winners and his employees, and the second defendant had received a salary as a collector. Neither could fairly be characterized as involving the lottery's profits. The Government did not try to prove, and defendants had not admitted, that they laundered criminal profits. There was no more reason to think ""proceeds"" meant ""receipts"" than there was to think it meant ""profits."" The rule of lenity required it be interpreted in favor of defendants as ""profits."" If ""proceeds"" meant ""receipts,"" nearly every illegal-lottery violation would also be money-laundering, as paying a winner involved receipts intended to promote the lottery. Interpreting it as ""profits"" eliminated the merger problem. While it meant the Government had to prove more, it ensured the severe money-laundering penalties would be imposed only for the removal of profits from criminal activity, which permitted the leveraging of one criminal activity into the next. The prosecution had to show only that a single instance of specified unlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a charged transaction.

"In order to increase exploratory efforts for new sources of gas, the Federal Power Commission, pursuant to the Natural Gas Act (15 USCS 717 et seq.), promulgated an order exempting small producers of natural gas from direct rate regulation, but subjecting their rates to indirect regulation through the Commission's review of the cost of gas purchased from them by pipelines and large producers who were to be permitted to file ""tracking increases"" in their regulated sales rates, but who were to be required to make refunds to their customers (unrecoverable from the small producers) for that part of their rates attributable to small producer rates which were ""unreasonably high,"" considering appropriate comparisons with highest contract prices for sales by large producers or the prevailing market price for intrastate sales in the same producing area. The order also provided generally that the Commission ""shall consider all relevant factors"" in determining whether proposed rates were consistent with the ""public convenience and necessity,"" and that the Commission intended to review new contract prices charged by small producers ""to insure the reasonableness of the rates"" charged by the producers. In proceedings to review the Commission's order, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the order, holding that it constituted an unauthorized ""deregulation"" of small producers since it failed to provide a mechanism for insuring that their rates would be ""just and reasonable,"" as required by the Natural Gas Act (154 App DC 168, 474 F2d 416).",Energy
"This case presented the basic issue whether the Interstate Commerce Commission's action in disallowing a rate reduction proposed by certain railroads was inconsistent with 15a(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which governs ratemaking in situations involving intermodal competition between carriers. A subsidiary but related issue was whether the Commission adequately articulated its reasons for disallowing the proposed rate. In making such disallowance the Commission, pending a rulemaking proceeding then before it to examine the whole question of the cost standards to be used in situations involving intermodal competition, adhered to a comparison between fully distributed costs, rather than between out-of- pocket costs as urged by the railroads, as the basis for determining which of the two competing modes of transportation--the railroads or a combined barge-truck service--had the inherent advantage on the traffic in question.

The individual denied that he lost his citizenship, but the Department of State issued a certificate of loss of nationality. After the Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State held a full hearing and affirmed that the individual had voluntarily renounced his United States citizenship, the individual brought suit against the Secretary of State in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking a declaration of his United States nationality. After a trial de novo, the District Court concluded that the United States had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual knowingly, understandingly, and voluntarily took an oath of allegiance to Mexico, and concurrently renounced allegiance to the United States, and that he had therefore voluntarily relinquished United States citizenship pursuant to 349(a)(2). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Congress had no power to legislate the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard contained in 349(c) of the Act (8 USCS 1481(c))--which provides that the party claiming loss of citizenship must ""establish such claim by preponderance of the evidence"" and that a person who commits any act of expatriation ""shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily,"" but may rebut the presumption upon a showing, ""by a preponderance of the evidence,"" that the act committed was done voluntarily--and that the Federal Constitution required that proof be by ""clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence.""

In response to interrogatories, the government asserted in a conclusory fashion that the taxpayer owed taxes for the years in question, based in part on income allegedly received from selling hashish.

However, a proviso stated that nothing in the provision was to be construed to prohibit picketing as a result of bona fide labor disputes regarding the alteration, repair, or construction of embassy buildings or premises.

The District Court determined that because Unicolors did not know when it filed its application that it had failed to satisfy the ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´single unit of publication‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ requirement, Unicolors‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• copyright registration remained valid by operation of the safe harbor provision provided under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º411(b)(1)(A). On appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that it did not matter whether Unicolors was aware that it had failed to satisfy the single unit of publication requirement, because the safe harbor excuses only good-faith mistakes of fact, not law. Unicolors had known the relevant facts, so its knowledge of the law (or lack thereof ) was irrelevant.",Law and Crime
"In 1942, the War Production Board issued Limitation Order L-208, ordering nonessential gold mines to close down. In 1952, Congress enacted a Special Jurisdictional Act giving the United States Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear, determine, and render judgment, notwithstanding any statute of limitations, laches, or lapse of time, on a claim of any owner or operator of a gold mine for losses incurred allegedly because of the closing or curtailment or prevention of operations of the mine as a result of Order L- 208. Respondents, whose mine was closed as a consequence of Order L-208, brought an action in the United States Court of Claims, seeking compensation for losses traceable to the closing, and that court held that respondents were entitled to just compensation (134 Ct Cl 1, 53, 56; 138 F Supp 281, 310, 312), and denied a new trial (134 Ct Cl 130; 146 F Supp 476).",Law and Crime
"A black employee of a halfway house operated by the Missouri department of corrections and human resources brought, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, an action under 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-2(a)(1)) alleging that the halfway house had violated 703(a)(1) by demoting and then discharging the employee because of his race. The District Court, acting as trier of fact in a full bench trial, (1) found that (a) the employee had established a prima facie case of racial discrimination, and (b) the reasons that the employer gave for the demotion and discharge were not the real reasons for the demotion and discharge, but (2) ruled for the employer on the basis that the employee had failed to carry his ultimate burden of proving that his race was the determining factor in the employer's allegedly discriminatory actions (756 F Supp 1244). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded, expressing the view that, once the employee had proved all of the employer's proffered reasons for the adverse employment actions to be pretextual, the employee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law (970 F2d 487).",Civil Rights
