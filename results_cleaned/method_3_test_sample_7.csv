"In a school desegregation case brought by parents of Denver school children in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, the District Court found that, for almost a decade, the Denver school board had engaged in an unconstitutional policy of deliberate racial segregation with respect to schools in the Park Hill area in northeast Denver; that the parents had failed to make a fresh showing of de jure segregation in other areas of the city, where the situation was ""more like de facto segregation""; and that the thus segregated core city schools were educationally inferior to the predominantly white schools in other parts of Denver. The court ordered desegregation of the Park Hill schools (303 F Supp 279, 303 F Supp 289) and implementation of a remedial plan, short of all-out desegregation but aimed at achieving ""substantial equality"" of educational opportunities, for the core city schools (313 F Supp 90). The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed as to the Park Hill schools but reversed as to the core city schools (445 F2d 990).",Civil Rights
"Three former airline captains brought suit against the airline after they were forced to retire upon reaching the age of 60, alleging a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) (29 USCS 621 et seq.). At issue was the airline's policy of permitting captains disqualified from serving in that capacity for reasons other than age to transfer automatically to the position of flight engineer, while requiring age-disqualified captains such as plaintiffs to bid for flight engineer vacancies and to retire if no vacancies occurred prior to their 60th birthdays or if they lacked sufficient seniority to bid for those vacancies that did occur. Under the ADEA, differential treatment of older workers is proscribed with respect to a privilege of employment. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered summary judgment for the airline (547 F Supp 1221) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed (713 F2d 940), concluding that age-disqualified captains are entitled to the same transfer rights as captains disqualified for other reasons. The Court of Appeals also held the airline liable for double damages (29 USCS 626(b)), because its violation of the Act was found to have been willful.",Labor
"The Secretary was authorized to accept land in trust for an Indian tribe, and ""Indian"" was defined in 25 U.S.C.S. _ 479 as a member of a ""recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdiction."" The State contended that the word ""now"" referred to the date of enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), of which _ 479 was a part, and that the tribe was not federally recognized at that time. The Secretary argued that ""now"" referred to the time when the Secretary accepted the land in trust, and that the tribe was federally recognized at that time. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the term ""now under Federal jurisdiction"" unambiguously referred to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted and, because the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction at that time, the Secretary lacked the authority to take the land into trust. At the time of enactment of the IRA, the ordinary meaning of the word ""now"" was ""at this moment"" or ""at the time of speaking,"" which clearly referred in _ 479 solely to matters existing contemporaneous with the enactment of the IRA, and such definition aligned with the natural reading of the word within the context of the IRA.",Civil Rights
"This case presented the question whether union signatory subcontracting clauses that are sought or negotiated in the context of a collective bargaining relationship are protected by the construction industry proviso to 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(e)). Section 8(e) prohibits ""secondary"" agreements between unions and employers which require an employer to cease doing business with another party, but the construction industry proviso to 8(e) exempts from this proscription agreements between a union and an employer in the construction industry over the contracting or subcontracting of work to be performed at a construction site. In one instance, a construction industry subcontractor, during collective bargaining negotiations, reached an impasse with a union over the union's demand that the contract include a union signatory subcontracting clause barring subcontracting except to firms who are signatories to agreements with particular unions. In support of their demands for a subcontracting clause, union locals picketed the subcontractor's construction site causing work stoppages, but the subcontractor filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board asserting that the clause violated 8(e) of the Act. It was further argued that because the clause violated 8(e), the picketing violated 8(b)(4)(A) of the Act (29 USCS 158(b)(4)(A)), which forbids coercion ""to enter into any agreement which is prohibited by"" 8(e). The Board ruled that the union signatory subcontracting clause at issue was saved by the construction industry proviso, and rejected the contention that the proviso sheltered subcontracting clauses only if the clauses were limited in application to particular job sites at which both union and nonunion workers were employed. According to the Board, such clauses are lawful when sought or negotiated in the context of collective bargaining relationships, and therefore picketing to obtain the clause was permitted under 8(b)(4)(A) (239 NLRB 241). A second dispute involved unfair labor practice charges filed against a union by a member of an association of construction industry employers asserting that a contract between the association and the union containing a union signatory subcontracting clause violated 8(e). The Board held that such clauses were protected by the proviso (239 NLRB 274). The subcontractor, the industry association, and the association member sought review of the Board's orders in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which, after consolidating the cases, ultimately enforced the orders. The court ruled that union signatory subcontracting clauses are protected so long as they are sought or negotiated in the context of a collective bargaining relationship, and that economic pressure may be used to obtain a subcontracting agreement, but that it may not be employed to enforce a subcontracting agreement (654 F2d 1301).",Labor

"An association which operated a community swimming pool limited its membership to 325 families, with preference being given to families residing within a 3/4 mile radius of the pool. A Negro couple purchased a home within the geographical preference area, but the association rejected a resolution to permit Negroes to become members, and the Negro couple were discouraged from applying for membership because of their race. After two white members brought a Negro guest to the pool, the association, in order to prevent members from bringing Negroes to the pool as guests, changed its policy so as to limit guests to members' relatives, and the Negro was subsequently denied admission as the white members' guest. The Negro couple, the two white members, and the Negro guest brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the association and its officers and directors, alleging violations of various federal civil rights statutes, and seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.

"After a railroad, the New Haven, had filed a petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and trustees had been appointed by the court, the New Haven's financial situation continued to deteriorate and the New Haven sought to be included in the merger of two other railroads, the Pennsylvania and the New York Central. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the Penn-Central merger and required the New Haven to be included in the merger (330 ICC 328). The decision approving the merger was upheld by a three-judge United States District Court in the Southern District of New York (279 F Supp 316), and the United States Supreme Court affirmed (389 US 486, 19 L Ed 2d 723, 88 S Ct 602). Subsequently, the Commission's determination of the price which Penn- Central had to pay for the New Haven's assets was subjected to simultaneous judicial review in both the reorganization court and the three-judge court. Both courts, concluding that the Commission had substantially understated the value of the property to be transferred, remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings (289 F Supp 418; 289 F Supp 451). A revised plan by the Commission was certified to the reorganization court, which, though accepting the Commission's determinations on some issues, (1) rejected the Commission's conclusions as to the valuation of certain freight yards and as to certain deductions, and (2) instituted an underwriting plan to insure equivalent value for the New Haven estate with respect to Penn- Central common stock given in partial consideration for the transferred New Haven properties (304 F Supp 793; 304 F Supp 1136). However, the three- judge court, while adopting the reorganization court's underwriting plan, disagreed with the reorganization court's rejection of the Commission's conclusions as to the freight yards and deductions (305 F Supp 1049).

"A 1916 congressional enactment (39 Stat 753), entitled An Act To amend certain sections of [the Federal Reserve Act of 1913], began by stating that the Act would be amended as follows and contained a series of apparently directory phrases which were not surrounded by quotation marks, followed by one or more paragraphs within opening and closing quotation marks; two successive directory phrases provided [t]hat [13] be, and is hereby, amended to read as follows: ""...."" and that [5202] of the Revised Statutes of the United States is hereby amended as follows: ""...."". The third paragraph following the latter phrase contained a new provision, initially codified as 12 USC 92 [12 USCS 92], which authorized any national bank located and doing business in any place with a population of 5,000 or less to act as the agent for any insurance company. In 1918, Congress amended 5202 to read as follows, and did not include 92 in the revised text (40 Stat 506). Subsequent editions of the United States Code through 1946 included 92, but the 1952 and succeeding editions omitted 92, with a note indicating that 92 had been repealed in 1918. Nevertheless, Congress and federal regulatory officials continued to act on the understanding that 92 remained the law; and in 1986, the United States Comptroller of the Currency approved a national bank's request to sell insurance through the bank's branch in a small Oregon community to customers nationwide, as the Comptroller interpreted 92 as permitting national bank branches located in small communities to sell insurance to customers outside as well as inside those communities. Trade organizations which represented insurance agents contended that the Comptroller's ruling was inconsistent with 92 and filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Comptroller, the Office of the Comptroller, and the United States. The District Court, in granting summary judgment for the federal defendants and for the requesting bank as defendant-intervenor, (1) noted that 92 apparently had been inadvertently repealed in 1918, but assumed--since Congress, the Comptroller, and other courts had presumed the continuing validity of 92--that the provision existed of its own force; and (2) expressed the view that the Comptroller's interpretation of 92 was rational and consistent with the statute (736 F Supp 1162). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court, and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the trade organizations, on the ground that 92 had been repealed in 1918 (293 US App DC 403, 955 F2d 731).

"A prisoner who challenges a State‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s proposed method of execution under the Eighth Amendment must identify a readily available alternative method that would significantly reduce the risk of severe pain. If the prisoner proposes a method already authorized under state law, the Court has held that his claim can go forward under 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983, rather than in habeas. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U. S. 637, 644‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬® 647. But the prisoner is not confined to proposing a method already authorized under state law; he may ask for a method used in other States. See Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. ___, ___. The question presented is whether a prisoner who does so may still proceed under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983. Petitioner Michael Nance brought suit under ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983 to enjoin Georgia from using lethal injection to carry out his execution. Lethal injection is the only method of execution that Georgia law now authorizes. Nance alleges that applying that method to him would create a substantial risk of severe pain. As an alternative to lethal injection, Nance proposes death by firing squad‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üa method currently approved by four other States. The District Court dismissed Nance‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983 suit as untimely. The Eleventh Circuit rejected it for a different reason: that Nance should have advanced his method-of-execution claim by way of a habeas petition rather than a ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1983 suit. A habeas petition, that court stated, is appropriate when a prisoner seeks to invalidate his death sentence. And the Eleventh Circuit thought that was what Nance was doing. It asserted that Georgia law‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Üwhich again, only authorizes execution by lethal injection‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö√Ühad to be taken as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´fixed.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ 981 F. 3d 1201, 1211. Under that ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´fixed‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ law, the court said, enjoining Georgia from executing Nance by lethal injection would mean that he could not be executed at all.

"After the United States Department of Justice had obtained an agreement whereby a county school board undertook to desegregate a dual, racially segregated county school district consisting of 22 percent white students and 77 percent Negro students, and after the state department of public instruction, acting on a request from the county school board, had recommended a detailed desegregation plan, the North Carolina state legislature enacted a statute authorizing a city within the county to create a separate school district. About 57 percent of the students in the city's public schools were white, and about 43 percent were Negro, and if the city had its own school district, a formerly all-white school in the city would retain a white majority, while a formerly all-Negro school just outside the city would be 91 percent Negro. In the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the United States sought injunctive relief against the establishment of a separate school district for the city. The District Court granted an injunction, holding that the state statute was enacted with the effect of creating a refuge for white students, and that the statute interfered with the desegregation of the county school system (314 F Supp 65).

"Some black individuals and a civil rights organization filed separate class action complaints against an Alabama city and a county personnel board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and alleged that the city and the board had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring and promotion practices, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) and other federal law. Prior to judgment, the parties entered into two consent decrees which included goals for the hiring and promotion of black firefighters. A firefighters' association filed objections to the proposed decrees as amicus curiae, but the District Court (1) denied as untimely motions to intervene by the association and two of its members, and (2) approved the consent decrees (28 BNA FEP Cas 1834). Seven white firefighters, all members of the association, then filed a complaint against the city and the board, seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of the decrees, but the District Court denied relief. On appeal, both the denial of intervention and the denial of injunctive relief were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (720 F2d 1511), which also denied rehearing en banc (724 F2d 978). A new group of white firefighters then brought suit against the city and the board in the District Court and claimed that (1) the city and the board were making promotion decisions on the basis of race, in reliance on the consent decrees; and (2) these decisions constituted impermissible racial discrimination, in violation of the Federal Constitution and federal statutes including Title VII. Several blacks were allowed to intervene in their individual capacities to defend the decrees. Eventually, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss the white firefighters' cases as an impermissible collateral attack on the consent decrees and expressed the view that (1) if in fact the city was required by one of the consent decrees to make the promotions, then there would be no illegal racial discrimination, and (2) the defendants had established that the promotions of black individuals were in fact required by the terms of one of the consent decrees. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, reversing and ordering a remand, expressed the view that, because the new group of white firefighters were neither parties nor privies to the consent decrees, their independent claims of unlawful discrimination were not precluded (833 F2d 1492).

The United States District Court for the District of Colorado, concluding that the wife had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, granted the town's motion to dismiss.",Law and Crime
"Defendants were convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on both counts of a two-count indictment. Nonconcurrent sentences were imposed upon them. Affirming the convictions, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit refused to consider the question whether the record contained sufficient evidence of violations charged in the two counts to support the imposition of nonconcurrent sentences, resting its decision on the ground that defendants did not move for acquittal at the close of all the evidence.

"A union member who failed to tender his October dues until November 10 was declared suspended from membership and at the union's request was discharged by his employer. Under the union's constitution, dues were payable on the first day of the month; a member in arrears after the 15th day of the month was not in good standing; one allowing his arrearage to run into the second month was debarred from benefits for one month after payment; and one allowing his arrearage to run over the last day of the second month suspended himself. The collective bargaining agreement included a maintenance of membership provision. The union member sued for reinstatement and damages in the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, and recovered damages on the ground that because he was less than two months in arrears on November 10, he was not suspended and therefore was not subject to discharge. The Idaho Supreme Court affirmed. (93 Idaho 294, 460 P2d 719.)",Labor
"A railroad's clerical employee whose duties consisted in filing original tracings of all the railroad's engines, cars, parts, tracks, bridges, and other structures, from which blueprints of those items were made, and in procuring blueprints to fill orders received both from within and without the state, was injured when a cracked windowpane in her office blew in upon her. She sought recovery in an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The act, as amended in 1939, affords coverage to any employee of a carrier, any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate commerce, or shall, in any way directly or closely and substantially, affect such commerce. The District Court ruled that the employee was not within the coverage of the statute, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.",Labor
"Two railroad companies voluntarily merged. The Interstate Commerce Commission, whose approval was necessary, found that the merger was consistent with the public interest and that its terms were just and reasonable to each group of shareholders. It deemed itself without jurisdiction, however, to pass upon the claim of certain dissenting preferred stockholders that by the terms of the merged railroad's charter they were entitled to receive the equivalent of the par value of their stock and unpaid cumulative dividends, and remitted them to their remedies in the state courts, merely finding that, however settled, the claim did not involve enough to affect the solvency of the new company or jeopardize its operations.",Transportation
"A libel action was instituted in a Florida state court against a newspaper, based on a false story that the plaintiff, who at the time of the story was city mayor and a candidate for the office of county tax assessor, had been charged in a federal court with perjury in a civil rights suit, and that his case had been held over until the following term of the federal court, whereas the story in fact should have referred to the plaintiff's brother. The trial court instructed the jury that the article was libelous per se, and that the jury's only task was to determine damages. After the jury awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiff, the trial court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, ruling that since the libelous article did not relate to the public offices held or sought by the plaintiff, the case was not governed by the constitutional rule prohibiting a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proved that the statement was made with actual malice, that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed (221 So 2d 459), and the Supreme Court of Florida refused to review the judgment (231 So 2d 822).",Law and Crime
"A provision of the California Constitution prohibits a political party or a party central committee from endorsing, supporting, or opposing a candidate for nonpartisan office. An action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by 10 registered voters residing in the city and county of San Francisco. Among the 10 voters were the chairman and three members of the county central committee of one political party, and one member of the county central committee of another political party. In the complaint--which sought a declaration that the California constitutional provision violated the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, and an injunction preventing the city and county from editing candidates' statements in a voter's pamphlet, which was printed and distributed by the city and county, so as to delete references to party endorsements--it was alleged that (1) the plaintiff committee members desired to endorse candidates for nonpartisan offices, and to have such endorsements published in the voter's pamphlet; (2) all the plaintiff voters desired to read endorsements as part of candidates' statements printed in the voter's pamphlet; (3) in the past, all references in candidates' statements to endorsements by party central committees or their officers or members were deleted from the voter's pamphlet, and such deletions would continue unless restrained by court order; (4) the state constitutional provision abridged rights to free speech and association; and (5) the plaintiff voters had suffered and would suffer irreparable injury to such rights because of the deletions. In addition, affidavits submitted in connection with the voters' motion for summary judgment indicated that (1) one party central committee had a policy of endorsing candidates for nonpartisan offices; (2) another party central committee had declined to endorse candidates for nonpartisan office in some elections solely out of concern that committee members might be criminally or civilly prosecuted for violation of the state constitutional provision; and (3) one party's name had been deleted from candidate statements in two instances. The District Court, granting summary judgment for the voters, declared the California constitutional provision unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement (708 F Supp 278). On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed (880 F2d 1062), but on rehearing en banc the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision (911 F2d 280).",Civil Rights
