"The competitor contended that its invalidity defense required only a showing by a preponderance of the evidence which must apply at least when the invalidity defense rested on evidence of a predecessor invention that was never considered in the process of examining the holders' patent. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the presumption of validity of the patent and the burden on the competitor to show invalidity under 35 U.S.C.S. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 282 established a requirement that patent invalidity be shown by clear and convincing evidence. Although ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ 282 did not explicitly set out the applicable standard of proof to establish invalidity of the patent, the presumption of validity had a settled common-law meaning which was consistently construed in the common law to require clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. Further, the fact that evidence of the predecessor invention was not considered by the patent examiner, while bolstering the competitor's claim of patent invalidity under the standard of clear and convincing evidence, did not alter the standard of proof to a preponderance of the evidence.",Law and Crime
"A failure to report under 720 ILCS 5/31-6(a) was a separate crime, different from escape under section 5/31-6(a) and from failure to abide by the terms of home confinement. The behavior of failing to report seemed less likely to involve a risk of physical harm than escape. Moreover, escape and failure to report were listed separately and the behaviors were placed in two different felony classes of different degrees of seriousness. Failure to report was characterized by a failure to present oneself for detention on a specified occasion. It did not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another for purposes of _ 924(e)(2)(B)(i) and did not involve conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. There was no reason to believe that an offender who failed to report was doing something that was posing a serious potential risk of physical injury under _ 924(e). Statistics showed only a small risk of physical violence for those who failed to report. The felon's crime fell outside the scope of ACCA's definition of ""violent felony"" in _ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).",Law and Crime
"In an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, brought against certain police officers under 42 USCS 1983, the father of a boy who had been shot and killed by the officers while the boy was attempting to escape arrest, sought to recover damages and to obtain a declaratory judgment that Missouri statutes authorizing the police to use deadly force in apprehending a person who has committed a felony, following notice of the intent to arrest, were unconstitutional. The District Court initially held that a defense of good faith had been established, and denied both forms of relief, but on appeal only from the denial of declaratory relief, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that such relief was available and remanded the case for consideration of the constitutional issue (502 F2d 588). On remand, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, making no claim for damages, and the District Court upheld the Missouri statutes (404 F Supp 643). However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statutes were unconstitutional (547 F2d 1007).",Civil Rights
"The Medicare statute lays out a formula that the Department of Health and Human Services must employ annually to set reimbursement rates for certain outpatient prescription drugs provided by hospitals to Medicare patients. 42 U. S. C. ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii). That formula affords HHS two options. Option 1 applies if HHS has conducted a survey of hospitals‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• acquisition costs for each covered outpatient drug. Under this option, the agency may set reimbursement rates based on the hospitals‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´average acquisition cost‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ for each drug, and may ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´vary‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ the reimbursement rates ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´by hospital group.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I). Absent a survey, option 2 applies, and HHS must set reimbursement rates based on ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´the average price‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ charged by manufacturers for the drug as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´calculated and adjusted by the Secretary.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ ¬¨¬®‚àö√º1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). Option 2 does not authorize HHS to vary reimbursement rates for different hospital groups. From the time these provisions took effect in 2006 until 2018, HHS did not conduct surveys of hospitals‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• acquisition costs, relied on option 2, set the reimbursement rates at about 106 percent, and did not vary those rates by hospital group. For 2018, HHS again did not conduct a survey. But this time it issued a final rule establishing separate reimbursement rates for hospitals that serve low-income or rural populations through the 340B program and all other hospitals. For 2019, HHS set reimbursement rates the same way. The American Hospital Association and other interested parties challenged the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates in federal court. In response, HHS first contended that various statutory provisions precluded judicial review of those rates. The agency also argued that it could vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group under its option 2 authority to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´adjust‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ the price-based reimbursement rates. The District Court rejected HHS‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s argument that the statute precluded judicial review, concluded that HHS had acted outside its statutory authority, and remanded the case to HHS to consider an appropriate remedy. The D. C. Circuit, however, reversed. The court ruled that the statute did not preclude judicial review, and upheld HHS‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s reduced reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.",Health

"After the Internal Revenue Service had summarily seized a taxpayer's bank accounts pursuant to a jeopardy assessment for income taxes under 26 USCS 6213, 6331, 6861, the taxpayer instituted an action for injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that he owed no tax, that he needed the money in the frozen bank accounts as bail money upon his imminent extradition to face criminal charges in a foreign country, that he could not litigate the issue as to his tax liability while in jail in the foreign country, and that the government had deliberately and in bad faith waited until three days before his scheduled extradition before filing its notices of levy. In response to interrogatories, the government asserted in a conclusory fashion that the taxpayer owed taxes for the years in question, based in part on income allegedly received from selling hashish. The District Court granted the government's motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of the Anti-Injunction Act (26 USCS 7421(a)), which generally prohibits suits to restrain the assessment or collection of federal taxes, the District Court also holding that it had no jurisdiction over the extradition order. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, although affirming the holding of lack of jurisdiction over the extradition order, reversed with regard to the District Court's holding that the Anti-Injunction Act required dismissal of the complaint, the Court of Appeals ruling that under the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act whereby an injunction could be obtained if it was clear that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail, and if equity jurisdiction otherwise existed in that the taxpayer showed that he would otherwise suffer irreparable injury, the taxpayer had satisfied the test as to the showing of irreparable injury, and the District Court should have conducted further inquiry into the factual foundation for the jeopardy assessment (162 App DC 391, 499 F2d 527).",Law and Crime

"The Federal Communications Commission promulgated regulations governing the common ownership of communications media ( 47 CFR 73.35, 73.240, 73.636), which prospectively bar the initial licensing or transfer of a newspaper-broadcast combination consisting of a commonly owned radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same community, but which generally permit such existing newspaper-broadcast combinations to continue in existence, the only exception to the ""grandfathering"" of existing combinations being a requirement for divestiture, absent a waiver under established procedures, where there is common ownership either of the only daily newspaper and the only broadcast (radio or television) station serving a community, or of the only daily newspaper and the only television station serving a community. Various parties, including broadcast licensees who were subject to the divestiture requirement and various organizations concerned with broadcasting or newspaper publishing, petitioned for review of the regulations in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Numerous parties intervened in the action and the United States was made a respondent. Some of the parties in the proceeding argued that the regulations went too far in restricting cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations, while others contended that the regulations did not go far enough. The Court of Appeals affirmed the prospective ban on new licensing of co-located newspaper-broadcast combinations, holding that the prospective rules did not exceed the FCC's authority under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USCS 151 et seq.) and that the ban would not violate the First Amendment rights of newspaper owners, but the Court of Appeals vacated the limited divestiture rules and ordered the FCC to adopt regulations requiring the dissolution of all existing combinations that did not qualify for a waiver, since the court found that the limited divestiture requirement was arbitrary and capricious (181 US App DC 1, 555 F2d 938).",Law and Crime

The District Court held that the Pennsylvania 6-year statute of limitations governing claims on contracts, replevin, and trespass applied to the 1981 claims, and the District Court found that (1) the employer had discriminated in certain respects, and (2) the unions were also guilty of discriminatory practices (a) in failing to challenge discriminatory discharges of probationary employees, (b) in failing and refusing to assert instances of racial discrimination as grievances, and (c) in tolerating and tacitly encouraging racial harassment (580 F Supp 1114).

"The present case involved an attempt by the United States to reach certain property as a means of enforcing federal income tax liability with respect to each of two women, whose marital domicil had been in Louisiana, a community property state. During each woman's marriage, there had been certain years in which the women and their husbands had failed to file any federal income tax returns. One of the women subsequently was divorced, and she formally renounced her community property rights, pursuant to Article 2410 of the Louisiana Civil Code, which granted a wife the privilege of being able to exonerate herself from the debts contracted during the marriage by renouncing the community of gains; the other woman's husband subsequently died, and she did not accept any benefits of the community. With respect to each woman, the United States sought to impose federal income tax liability allocable to half of the community income for the years in which no tax returns had been filed. With respect to the divorced woman, the Tax Court held that under Louisiana community property law, the woman had possessed an immediate vested ownership interest in half the community property and was personally liable for the tax on her share, and that this tax liability was not affected by her Article 2410 renunciation (51 T Ct 641). Similarly, with respect to the woman whose husband had died, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana upheld the government's right to impose tax liability on the woman for her share of the community income. As to each woman, however, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment below and held that a woman, by renouncing the community or by failing to accept any benefits of the community, avoided any federal income tax liability on the community income.

"In addition to questions pertaining to alleged constitutional violations affecting the validity of a state court conviction for murder, this case presented the major question of the constitutionality of the imposition of the death penalty under an Ohio statute requiring a death sentence for a conviction of aggravated murder with at least one of seven aggravating circumstances, unless, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character, and condition of the offender, the sentencer (the trial judge in a jury case, or the three-judge panel which tries the case when a jury is waived) determines that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that (1) the victim induced or facilitated the offense, (2) it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation, or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency (not amounting to insanity). After a jury trial in an Ohio state court, the defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications that it was committed to escape apprehension for, and while committing or attempting to commit, aggravated robbery.

"Under an 1854 treaty, an Indian tribe received certain lands on the west bank of the Missouri River which, at the time, were part of the Territory of Nebraska. The eastern boundary of the reservation was fixed as the center of the main channel of the Missouri River. In 1867, a survey established that the reservation included a large peninsula jutting east toward the Iowa side of the river, around which the river flowed. In subsequent years the river changed course several times, and, since 1927, has been west of its 1867 position, leaving most of the survey area on the Iowa side of the river, and separated from the rest of the reservation. Iowa residents eventually settled on the land, but, in 1975, were dispossessed by the tribe with assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Following the seizure, three federal actions were instituted against, among others, the state of Iowa and several individuals by the Indian tribe and the United States as trustee of the land. These actions, in which both sides sought to quiet title in their names, were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Initially, the District Court concluded that state law, rather than federal law, should be the basis of decision. The court then determined that 25 USCS 194, which provides that, in all property disputes between Indians and ""white persons,"" the burden of proof rests with the white person whenever the Indian makes out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership, was inapplicable, since the tribe could not prove that it had previously possessed the land in question without proving its case on the merits. Applying Nebraska law, which places the burden of proof on the party seeking to quiet title, the court decided that the key changes in the river had been accretive, as opposed to avulsive, and that therefore the defendant east-bank riparians were the owners of the disputed area (433 F Supp 67). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court should have applied federal rather than state law, and that the District Court had erred by refusing to apply 25 USCS 194. The Court of Appeals concluded that, by applying federal common law relative to accretion and avulsion, the evidence was in equipoise, and therefore, under 194, judgment for the Indian tribe was proper (575 F2d 620).",Law and Crime

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia, (1) vacated the defendant's rape conviction, along with the death penalties on the counts involving the rape, on the ground that the jury had not properly convicted the defendant of ""forcible"" rape (required for a death sentence), because the jury had been instructed both on forcible and statutory rape but had not specified in its verdict which offense it had found, but (2) affirmed the other convictions and the imposition of the death penalty on the murder count (241 Ga 49, 243 SE2d 496).",Law and Crime

An accused who had at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence was, with respect to a five-count indictment resulting from his robbing of a bank when he was at least 18 years old, convicted of the federal crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (1) found that the felon-in-possession offense was a crime of violence, and (2) relying only on that offense, sentenced the accused as a career offender. At the time of the felon-in-possession conviction, 4B1.2 of the Guidelines defined a crime of violence to include any offense that was punishable by imprisonment for more than a year and involved conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re- lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol- lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. The de- fendants did not appeal any of the District Court‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orders. In 2006, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, in- creased ELL incremental funding. The incremental funding increase required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill. The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here. The Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superinten- dent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in light of HB 2064. In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). The District Court denied their mo- tion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule 60(b)(5) claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted Rule 60(b)(5). On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding system. Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant re- lief.",Civil Rights
"A seaman filed suit against a shipowner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, based on a claim that while working on the defendant's ship, he suffered a head injury which resulted in an ear disorder, the complaint including a count for maintenance and cure. The shipowner's medical witness, whose testimony at the trial was the only medical diagnosis as to when the ear disorder became permanent and not susceptible to curative treatment, conceded that the seaman's head injury could have caused the ear disorder, but also said that the disorder was not a condition that could be cured by treatment. After the jury awarded the seaman an amount for maintenance and cure, the shipowner moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the award was not within the permissible scope of maintenance and cure. The District Court denied the motion, holding that maintenance and cure, although not available for a sickness declared to be permanent, continued until such time as the incapacity was declared to be permanent. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in an unpublished opinion (see 495 F2d 1374), reversed as to the maintenance and cure point, holding that once the seaman reached maximum medical recovery the shipowner's obligation to provide maintenance and cure ceased, and that since the record did not permit an inference other than that the seaman's condition was permanent immediately after the accident, the District Court's holding impermissibly extended the shipowner's obligation.",Law and Crime
"In 1973, federal prison inmates filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that prison officials had violated the inmates' rights under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment by, among other things, rejecting certain publications that had been sent to the inmates from outside the prison. The lawsuit was certified as a class action, and three publishers of publications that had been rejected at federal prisons were later added as party plaintiffs. In 1979, when the class action had not yet been tried, the Federal Bureau of Prisons promulgated regulations dealing with the rejection of publications. One provision ( 28 CFR 540.70) generally permits a federal prison inmate to subscribe to or to receive a publication--defined as a book, a single issue of a magazine or newspaper, or other materials such as advertising brochures, fliers, and catalogs--without prior approval. However, this right is restricted by further provisions ( 540.71) that (1) authorize the warden to reject a publication if it is determined to be detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity, (2) contain a nonexhaustive list of criteria that may support rejection of a publication, (3) require the warden to review separately each issue of a subscription publication, and (4) provide procedural safeguards for both the recipient and the sender. The inmates and publishers alleged that these regulations were invalid on their face and as applied to 46 specific rejections of publications. The inmates and publishers also challenged a practice known as the ""all-or-nothing"" rule, under which prison officials reject in its entirety any incoming publication that contains material that is excludible under the Bureau's regulations. In 1984, the District Court issued an opinion upholding the regulations and the all-or-nothing rule on their face on the ground that they were related to legitimate penological objectives, but the opinion did not address the propriety of the 46 rejections. The inmates' and publishers' claims for injunctive relief were accordingly denied by the District Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, reversing as to the denial of relief from rejection of publications, (1) held that (a) the appropriate standard of review was the one enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Procunier v Martinez (1974) 416 US 396, 40 L Ed 2d 224, 94 S Ct 1800, under which a restriction on inmate correspondence that furthers an important or substantial government interest is nevertheless invalid under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment if its sweep is unnecessarily broad, and (b) neither the regulations nor the all-or-nothing rule satisfied the Martinez test; and (2) remanded the case to the District Court for an individualized determination of the constitutionality of the 46 rejections (824 F2d 1166).",Civil Rights
"In 1977 and 1980, two groups of prisoners filed federal class actions, under 42 USCS 1983, challenging the conditions of confinement in the Michigan prison system. The defendants in both suits were prison officials. The prisoners prevailed in both suits, and, in each case, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that the prisoners were ""prevailing parties"" entitled to attorneys' fees, under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976 (42 USCS 1988), for postjudgment monitoring of the defendants' compliance with remedial decrees. Systems were established for awarding those fees on a semiannual basis, and the District Court established specific market rates for awarding fees. On April 26, 1996, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) became effective, and 803(d)(3) of the PLRA (42 USCS 1997e(d)(3)) placed a cap on the size of fees that could be awarded to attorneys who litigated prisoner lawsuits. On the effective date of the PLRA, the prevailing market rate in both cases was $ 150 per hour, but, under the PLRA, fees in the Eastern District were capped at a maximum hourly rate of $ 112.50. In both cases, the District Court, in considering fee requests for postjudgment monitoring performed before the PLRA was enacted, concluded that the PLRA cap did not limit attorneys' fees in these cases for services performed prior to, but still unpaid by, the PLRA's effective date. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed these decisions. Fee requests next were filed in both cases for services performed between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 1996, a period encompassing work performed both before and after the PLRA's effective date. In each case, in nearly identical orders, the District Court reiterated its earlier conclusion that the PLRA did not limit fees for work performed before the effective date, but concluded that the PLRA cap did limit fees for services performed after the effective date. The Court of Appeals consolidated the appeals from these orders, and affirmed in part and reversed in part. The Court of Appeals held that the PLRA's fee limitation did not apply to cases which were pending on the enactment date, and that if the fee limitation did so apply, it would have an impermissible retroactive effect, regardless of when the work was performed (143 F3d 246).",Law and Crime
"A suit was commenced in a Montana state court against members of the Blackfeet Indian Tribe, who resided on an Indian reservation in Montana, to recover on a debt arising from the Indians' purchase of food on credit from a grocery store located on the reservation. In 1967, the Blackfeet Tribal Council enacted a tribal law providing that the Tribal Court and the state should have concurrent jurisdiction over all actions wherein the defendant was a member of the Tribe. However, the state thereafter took no action under a 1953 federal statute (67 Stat 590) which authorized any state, not otherwise having jurisdiction in Indian country located therein, to assume such jurisdiction by affirmative legislative action. Furthermore, there had not been any tribal consent given to the state's assumption of jurisdiction, by a majority vote of the affected adult Indians voting at a special election called for such purpose, as was required by Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which repealed the 1953 statute except as to jurisdiction previously acquired thereunder. The trial court overruled the defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground that the state courts lacked jurisdiction because the defendants were members of the Blackfeet Tribe and the transaction took place on the reservation, and the Supreme Court of Montana affirmed such ruling.
